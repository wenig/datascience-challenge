Highly unprofessional in every aspect. \u00a0One of the biggest regrets I have was wasting over a year of my 20's at this joke of a sales job. Might as well be tele-marketing. Not a true inside sales environment when leads are absolutely destroyed from being called multiple times a day from different reps. Some companies claimed they were called 60 times a month. Management is virtually non-existent. Only care about your most recent sales numbers and that is ALL. Very short leash, extremely high turnover, very little guidance from team leads. Even the tenured managers only care about their own tenured reps, and feed them leads/sales once in a while. Managers should be helping reps close deals! not micro-managing and checking calls and talk time every few hours, announcing them for everyone to hear. One week of LOUSY in-house \"training\" where you learn the bare-minimum of the product set. WORST marketing team, cant even call them marketing, as they spend most of their efforts tracking call numbers of sales reps and reporting them to management. Company never spends money on advertising or getting their name out there, other than on their own websites. OH and they deploy dirt cheap promotions that undercut sales reps deals by turning a 1-2K sale into $100-$300 sales. Reps lose sales to re-sellers of the company.

New Hires are expected to sit in a cube and sell over the phone without product knowledge, nor any suggested easy to understand selling techniques. That is because NOBODY there has any. 3) Because of the new hires inexperience and eagerness, they are taken advantage off. The reduced commissions, declined payment on closed deals, and lack of support from Sr Sales Members is the deal of the day. 4) Some of the Senior Sales People are constantly conducting \"under the table\" deals, leaving the new hires without a chance to earn money nor make quota. Is all about them making money, they do not care who they hurt in the process.... Talking about KARMA!!!! 5) There are a couple of talented and skilled people still working at Comodo, however they are afraid of loosing their jobs. Therefore, this diamonds in disguise purposely hide at the bottom/ middle of the ladder because they are afraid of becoming the \"CEO's Flavor Of The Month\". This means that the CEO because of his obsessive compulsive nature, will start focusing on you, walking around your desk, asking you questions in front of everyone that only try to challenge your intelligence while comparing it to his own. The result, if the he gets bored or finds out you can outshine him, the chances of getting fired are very high. 6) Comodo also have A LOT of uneducated and incompetent people employed. These individuals are occupying positions that are key cornerstones for the success of the company. If anyone that has any values or education end up working with/or for them, soon ends up learning absolutely nothing because they do not have anything solid to offer. As a matter of fact I think you will forget anything good you had learned in the past 7) Upper Management is blind on one side, with a CEO that has a huge unsupported Ego and by conclusion a lot of Greed.

Instead of trying to create a smoke mirror for outside talent to believe that COMODO is an excellent workplace, by leaving fake happy reviews in this site. Eventually and if they get hired, they will too find out of the reality of Comodo, will quit or get fired and then you will have even more negative reviews. Fire all the maggots holding your key positions in the company because you think they are loyal, the reality is they are NOT.
