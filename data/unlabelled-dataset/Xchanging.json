No matter how right you are, you can\u2019t say anything to your manager. He is the ultimate boss even if he is completely wrong. 2. Food sucks big time in the cafetaria. The guy at cafetaria is innovating on new dishes. But quality sucks. 3. You are a slave to the client. Even if client asks you to dance nude. You will have to. The company's management or manager will not stand for you. 4. Company management only knows to speak. They can't fulfil any of the commitments. Even they don't have control over salary hike of the employees. Many people leave the company because they don't get the salary hike on time. And worst part is that if you resign and next month the hike comes for other employees. It is pure cheating as employee is still entitled to get his/her arrears for the days he has worked. You are told when you resign that even if there is a salary hike happening in your notice period, You will not get the hike. This is purely cheating. 5. You can only survive if you are a Yes master to ur manager. In simple words, if you can lick your manager. You are an exceptionally performing employee. 6. No clear vision or strategy for the company. You are like a sheep in herd. You come, you work, you get paid. Don\u2019t bother about tomorrow. They company is also not bothered about its tomorrow. They say, they are part of two big companies. But nobody has seen one company doing anything at all. We just use the name in our signatures... ha ha. 7. Townhalls are conducted as if management is doing a favour on employees. They give only vague and unrealistic aspirations. If asked about commitments from previous townhalls, they won't have an answer. 8. No idea on what other departments are doing. Absolutely no interconnectivity between departments. Everybody works in silos. 9. Some HODs or Senior management people behave as if they own the department and the people too. Shouting and screaming has become part of their DNA. Also, just by ridiculing an ethnicity or race, you are creating more trouble for yourself outside the office. 10. Last, but very important to consider - Forget that you have a family if you work here. You are made to work late nights and on weekends and holidays without any proper compensations. And dare you don't come to office when your manager asks you to, even if you have a sick child at home or its your anniversary. Forget everything and rush to office. Else for entire year your performance will be rated low. Advice to Management Set the vision for the company. Communicate that vision with clear strategy and roadmap to achieve.

Company has a flexible attitude to work hours in all departments where this is feasible - it's not uncommon for people to work extra hours early in the week and bank time for shorter Fridays, and many people shift their work hours to something like 8am-4:30 or 09:30 - 6pm. Employees regularly run charity fund-raising events in the building for the yearly sponsored charity, and the office has a relatively laid-back approach to dress requirements. Cons The take-over by CSC has been an abysmal experience. Everyone understands that redundancies and restructuring is an expected part of any take-over. But redundancies were communicated extremely poorly to affected staff and their managers, and the effect on staff morale has been staggering. Communications from head-office about impending cuts are issued without any notice to senior staff, leaving managers and team leaders reeling to find information for worried staff. People recently made redundant weren't told their redundancy package until a handful of days before their official end date, or were given conflicting information. The new owner has flat cut the Christmas party, all discretionary budgets, work-related travel expenses *including compensating staff travelling to fulfil contractually-required meetings with customers and clients*. Communication from the new senior management is opaque, jargon-filled and often makes no sense. Staff commonly receive a blanket communication about mandatory training/attendance\" for something that, it later turns out, affects only a specific division of the company. A recent mistake related to bonus pay-outs was handled abysmally, with affected people having their mis-paid bonuses deducted from their next wages with zero notice, not even being told at all until they noticed the discrepancy in their payslip and made enquiries, which resulted in some people incurring rent arrears or struggling to cover travel costs to the office. The various benefits of remaining in this job over others are diminishing rapidly, and it is very clear that the company is no longer a competitive UK employer for London Insurance Market roles. Advice to Management Communicating with staff is not a case of sending out an email once a month. Communication is a two-way process. Being pro-active about contacting staff and taking the time to make sure you phrase communication in simple, clear language can make a huge difference to how secure and motivated staff feel. If a payroll error with bonuses happens, contact all affected people by letter immediately after learning of the issue, especially if bonuses are small enough that most people will spend them on a single splurge rather than invest them. Make arrangements so their team leaders are aware, and make sure they know the timeline for repayment ASAP. Have a structure in place to assist staff who may be adversely affected by the error. When announcing redundancies, contact affected departments before the general comms go out. Make sure that when affected departments are named in an email, you name that department and not *the entire company division the department sits under*. Have a named contact, with a listed email address, staff can refer concerns to if they don't understand any particular comms. Just try to make some basic effort.", "rating": 3, "pros": "Wages for the Folkestone office are above-average for the area.
