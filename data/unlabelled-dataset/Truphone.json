But hear me out and then make your own opinion. As a current employee, I have worked at Truphone for just over a year now. It is a small company, learning to be bigger and better and this is a tough road. We have a new CEO, who has come in with bright ideas and with enthusiasm and promise of change and he has changed some areas extensively. which has created changes in our structure. As humans, we are reluctant to change. Something that always happens and there is no avoiding it, but generally people don\u2019t like change. But we are all still paid to do our jobs. This CEO has come in with energy and purpose another thing people are not always warm to. There have been comments on Glassdoor of bad management and leadership which may be true in some cases but Truphone now has a fresh new team of directors on the Exec, who are open-minded, energetic with fresh ideas., strong focus and taking people with them. Truphone has a great product, fantastic ideas and it wants enthusiastic energetic people to work for them. From a personal side, the one thing I can say about Truphone is this. Never have I ever been accepted more from a company than I have at Truphone. They embrace people with enthusiasm, they embrace people with ideas and those that think out of the box. It is not a company for wallflowers I will give you that, but it is a company that if you have ideas and you want to have them heard, this is the company for you. Some comments suggest that the CEO is unapproachable which is not true. He has an open-door policy you just need to step through it! In fact, all the directors have an open-door policy and they welcome ideas from everyone and anyone. The work is interesting and varied, the people are very bright and fantastic to work with. It is a multinational, multi-cultural company and if you want to have fun and get paid for it this is the company for you. So, believe what you want, listen to the bad reviews, or make your own opinion. This is my opinion and I really enjoy working here. You make of it what you put into it. And my favourite motto \u2013 if you enjoy what you do, you will never have to work a day in your life. Cons Sometimes could be a bit more transparent with new ideas and ongoings.

It's very high spec, quiet work environment (not noisy at all) , and obviously has an amazing view of London. Working in CS, I like the fact the teams are quite small, +- 6 people per language team. I also like it's multi-language. The learning pace is very calm, no rush and you can really do things at your own pace. Management is excellent, no annoying call times where they stand next to your desk trying to rush you onto the next call. Most of the work is e-mail bases / case driven. You do get phone calls, but 10 on a full shift is quite a lot! Because the teams are small, your colleagues feel like family, which is nice. Truphone is pretty innovative with their products, they have something that other telecom providers don't have. It's mostly aimed at the business market, so the customers you do talk to are nice and polite, no yelling people. There's always radio playing in the background and a lot of laughter, which makes working here very enjoyable. They are a relatively young company, so there's a lot of room to brainstorm for new ideas, which they actually take seriously. Some ideas you might have, might actually be implemented, which I find really cool to see and really missed working for other companies in the past. Also there's plenty of opportunity to grow in the company given they're still so young, which is great for career opportunities. CS works in shift patterns, where you will always be on the same shift for 1 week, i.e. 8 to 17:00 or 9 to 18:00. Opening times are 07:00 till 20:00 so you'll be working anytime between then. 07:00 means getting out of bed early, but as you'll be on this same shift all week, it's easy to get used to and plan your personal life around it, which is a really big pro for me. So far any leave I applied for was approved, which is a huge plus. Working in a small team is a big beneficial factor with this.

The work/life balance is good, some weekend work, but the effort is recognized by the execs which is good. Cons The business really needs to start making a big impact int he market space - it has such unique product, but doesnt have, in my opnion, the marketing and sales strategy right to leverage it. There CEO and COO are great guys but they need to get ideas into realistic actions, whilst keeping the funding going. At the moment its just not tight enough across the teams, which is a shame, as they are great people. Some people need to be less protective about their domains and start opening up to ideas. I didnt feel that HR had much to offer other than standard processes, anything from the CIPD and best practice might be there on paper, but its not there in actuality. Advice to Management You have a great product, great people. Yoiu are making the right steps to connect (in particular the COO) but you need that more often.

(Agile is just a funny word) Allot of people are just using space and wasting time while still getting money for it, but no one fires them. The worst ones are the individuals that have been there for more than 5 or 6 years. They have no interest in changing for the better (because them they would have to work for their money). The good professionals, the ones that really know how to do something and actually care, are either running away as fast as they can or are sent away because they don't cope with the incompetence around them. It's very political... The CEO is completely in the dark. That's why it's more important to be friends with important (and usually useless) people than to do your work. I could have helped Truphone (as many other colleagues that I know of), but now I'm just counting the days until I find another job and leave. Advice to Management The advice is for the CEO not Management, because Management is the real problem. Mr Steve, the people you trust the most (specially in the IT department) are the ones that are hiding everything that is wrong in the company, from you!
