The site that I work at is great. We have a great group of officers who are willing to help one another out. The schedule and pay is based off of the site that you are going to work for. I lucked out and work for one of the better organizations within the company. G4S is willing to give you career advancement as along as you put forth the effort. You will get out of the job whatever you are willing to put into the job. Benefits- If your single the benefits are not that expensive. I pay around $100 a paycheck for the top tier. $30 office co pay, $20 co pay for meds. Things like that. If you add a family though, it get very expensive.

Very laid back Super Easy work If you are wanting to work OT, you will have every opportunity there is Cons Everything is contractual- Pay, Vacation, Sick time ETC OT Pay- If you pick up OT, you get paid the amount that the site you are going to pays.

I think G4S needs to pay you your normal site pay. Vacation time and sick time are all in one bank. Also vacation and sick time does not build. You get one set amount after you have been with the company for a year. Once it is gone, it is gone. You have to wait another year to get more. Most places I am being told only give you 1 week for both sick and vacation time combined. No negotiation in pay when accepting a new position. You get what ever that site is paying the officers. This is regardless of your experience. If you have 10+ years experience and you start working with someone that has only 1 year of experience, you both make the same. Advice to Management G4S needs to have a standard accrual vacation package instead of just the one that the site you work at offers.
