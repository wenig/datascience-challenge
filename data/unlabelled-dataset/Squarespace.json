Catered lunch, though very unhealthy, it\u2019s also written into your salary package even if you don\u2019t partake in it. 100% paid for health/dental insurance, except that is also written into your salary package. Near transit, easy to get to the office. They don\u2019t provide a bus/train pass though. Because other companies don\u2019t provide it\u2026 except other companies absolutely do. Nice computers to work on/Equipment is up to date Pretty awesome coworkers, extremely talented folks in Customer Ops Work from home policy was nice (though, it was slowly being scaled back at the office I worked at.) CMS is easily implemented, easy to design with, though they tend to make changes that don\u2019t make sense to the customer nor designer working within it. Cons No time to learn new initiatives nor time to really get a good idea of the product if something new is added. Everything is dropped on customer service agents at the last possible moment (like an hour before public deploy, so they don\u2019t have time to understand what exactly will be expected of them.) At times the new initiatives when deployed break the platform or cause other issues. It doesn\u2019t seem like they tested these deployments thoroughly before making them public. As a customer service agent, you\u2019ll need to grow a thick skin due to developers inability to take constructive feedback, answer customer complaints, and constant need to stroke their ego. Be prepared to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Squarespace doesn\u2019t do that\u201d frequently. Feature requests up the chain do absolutely no good. They aren\u2019t read nor ever acted upon, they are merely a way to placate the customer. They are also summarily ignored like quickly dissipating smoke. When we did get trained on new initiatives or updates to the platform, it was conducted by people who never touched the product/platform, nor understood what or how it worked in actuality. Dedicated trainers would even provide unfocused and incorrect information to new hires. In the past, training was conducted by working peers who would pass on their tried and true knowledge before pushing new hires out into the queue. This was a better way to learn, learn from those who are actually doing the job versus those who never touch the product/platform day to day. No career growth, nor any opportunity to advance your career. Want to be a web designer or software engineer or grow into one of those roles? Better look elsewhere. Especially if you land a job in Dublin or Portland. The odds are only slightly better if you are in NYC, but even still, they don\u2019t grow their employees at all. They rarely look at internal talent when looking to fill managerial, technical, and design roles. It has been said that the job you interview for will be the same one you\u2019ll have 2+ years down the road. Executives absolutely know that the churn and burn rate is also 2 years per customer service agent as well. So don\u2019t expect to be mentored or recommended for promotions, you probably won\u2019t be there long enough to see any. Want to know why there are always \u201cclasses\u201d of newly hired people? It\u2019s because the seasoned folks who have reached burnout and have no outlet have left and they need to fill in the empty space. They could absolutely leverage their office locations and provide really fantastic places to work, like in Dublin. In Dublin, they could be the main European hub and provide support in native languages, not just English due to the availability of agents with multilingual backgrounds. In Portland, which is known for being a design and developer hub, they could provide not only template development, but tiered support and possibly even charge for in-house design and development. High stress without a way to alleviate that stress. The customer service floors are chaotic where team leads and supervisors have nerf dart gunfights over the heads of customer service agents trying to do their 5 chats an hour. It\u2019s loud, distracting, and you\u2019d better take advantage of the good headphones they offer you, you\u2019ll need them to cut out the noise. You are expected to take 2+ chats simultaneously and keep them at around 15 minutes long. Taking on an issue for a customer that lasts longer will affect your closely monitored metric (you can be written up if you deviate and only take say 4 chats per hour. The metric doesn\u2019t care if those chats are difficult to work through or require thought beyond billing questions.) Not only this, but they will micromanage you to death on just about everything. Want to work in the quiet rooms? They\u2019ll ask why you don\u2019t want to sit with your team. Interested in learning more about how JSON-T regioning works? They\u2019ll ask why when developer mode isn\u2019t supported by nor necessary for you to do your (customer service) job. Interested in applying for or wanting to do the summer internship in NYC? Why, aren\u2019t you happy doing customer service, I hope you don\u2019t want to leave *my* team. Want to ask your coworkers playing games around you if they\u2019d quiet down? You\u2019ll be seen as negative and not a team player. At every turn, they will attempt to placate and gaslight you and make you feel like you aren\u2019t deserving of any advancement nor respect. Workload. Here I\u2019ll talk about the office and role I worked. It probably comes as no surprise, I was a customer service agent. As a customer service agent, you were expected to take consecutive and simultaneous chats during the day. The total came about to 5 per hour. Doesn\u2019t seem like a lot written out, but let\u2019s play a small game. You take your 1st chat immediately after logging into the chat software. (Better make sure you have your coffee right then and there, you won\u2019t be getting up anytime soon.) Then the second one follows immediately after. If you miss it and the one after that, the system automatically logs you as \u201cinactive\u201d which will be marked down. Too many of these and your team lead will talk to you about timeliness in your next biweekly 1 on 1. As you take your chats, they are also expected to be about 10 - 15 minutes in length maximum. Going over this time and you\u2019ll be talked to about time management and cheerfully closing out your chats faster. It takes absolutely no consideration on the type of chat you are in nor if the customer is totally confused. You know what else this scenario doesn\u2019t take into account? The human need to stretch, use the facilities, have lunch, or refresh themselves in between chats with customers. Now multiply all this by 39. Thirty-nine hours per week that you will be taking on chats. They give you maybe one hour a week to learn something new. The one nice thing is that you do have the ability to transition a particularly tough chat to email to follow up, but usually the customer dictates when that happens, not you. The constant go-go-go of the metric and nature of the work is extremely tough to get through day after day after day. Even motivated people with a high work ethic have trouble with this constant after a couple months. I could venture a guess that this is why Squarespace tends to hire ex-Apple employees on the regular. But even they struggle with this workload after a couple months. Remember how I mentioned the catered lunches? Good luck making it down to grab a plate while in chats. Lunch was delivered around 11am and just about everyone will scramble to get a plate and get back to their desk in time to grab another chat before their scheduled lunch time. Team Leads and Supervisors would saunter down to grab a plate without a worry in the world. Agents would have to strategize and figure out the best way to get a plate while still scheduled in chats. Some wouldn\u2019t make it down at all and miss out on food, as a result having to make a quick lunch using available snacks and hustle back to their desk. (There was even a menu about how to make things using available ingredients in the snack cupboard if you missed lunch. Seriously.) MANY agents ate their lunch while still working regardless of when their actual lunch was scheduled. Burnout. <\u2014 This is a bad word at Squarespace. If you merely mention that you are starting to feel burnt out due to the workload, quite a few things will begin to happen. Your team lead will begin to be skeptical about your \u201cdevotion to the brand and the customers.\u201d A target will be placed on your back. Any and all concerns that you have had up to this point will be seen as negative. Any and all constructive feedback provided by others or by your team lead will come back to bite you. They will try to find ways to undermine your abilities and won\u2019t look to you for understanding or possible causation. You\u2019ll basically be tossed aside, your thoughts, experiences, and concerns placated until you decide to leave or they figure out a legal way to get rid of you. As a company, they will try to downplay the possibility that the workload causes burnout. Ask an executive (like the head of Customer Ops) about how they are handling this problem and they will sidestep the issue like a slick politician. The moonlighting policy is extremely biased. Say you feel like you\u2019ve learned a lot on the job and you\u2019d love to start creating sites for clients on the side. You know, so you can learn the product and make some side cash, because they aren\u2019t really allowing viable training time to learn new templates or the new initiatives. Not so fast, you will have to submit that to the legal team for approval. What if you\u2019re in school and are learning code or need to gain real world experience for a grade? What if you are in a business that is suddenly doing well? You\u2019ll have to submit all that to legal to ensure there is no conflict of interest. I understand that is an important part of a business to make sure there is discretion and no one is stealing customers, but the rules seem rather draconian in application. Do you want a normal 9-5 after the craziness that is shift work (at a retail store?) Better look elsewhere, your schedule is not your own and at the whim of \u201cneeds of the business\u201d. Guess what, it\u2019s shift work. It\u2019s seriously not better than your old retail position and the hours are longer and potentially more varied. The Portland office is especially susceptible to a varied schedule. You could be scheduled up to 11pm or midnight in some cases. Want to have a better balance between work and your life? You\u2019re better off at Starbucks or Apple where they at least close by 8pm. Think you got out of working on Saturdays and Sundays? Nope, you\u2019ll do at least one weekend a month. So that splitting up of a weekend midweek is still something you\u2019ll have to contend with. What about that \u201cunlimited\u201d vacation though, aren\u2019t you able to take a vacation when you need to? Um, no. That wonderful unicorn that is unlimited vacation is pretty limited and monitored. You get about 2 weeks per year, it doesn\u2019t accrue (so they don\u2019t have to pay you out if/when you leave), and is completely dependent upon how many people are already off from your team and office. The average for each office is around 2 people can be off at any specific time period. Fortunately, if you\u2019re sick or need a personal day (just one), you\u2019re ok. If you\u2019re sick, you could work from home. If you do submit time off for a vacation, better do it way far in advance and be sure to bring it up in conversation with your team lead frequently, they may attempt to gaslight you or \u201cforget\u201d about your request and you\u2019ll have to seek refunds for those plane tickets. Ineffectual HR. They ask current employees throughout the year to submit reviews on Glassdoor, LinkedIn, and other sites to puff themselves up and make them look awesome from the outside. So while there may be a lot of \u201cInnovative Place to Work\u201d or \u201cBest Job Ever\u201d reviews, the more lengthy and detailed ones saying \u201cMeh\u201d or \u201cYou Risk your Mental Health Working Here\u201d are ones to pay attention to and there is definitely truth within those. Granted, HR is there to ensure that the company\u2019s values are adhered to which is normal for any company. But when they attempt to mask the problems, flat out refuse to sign a diversity pledge, or place blame on employees for harassment, how can you seriously feel ok going to them if you have troubles while on the job. Not only that, but going to them with a grievance may put a target on your back due to the perception of your \u201cnegativity.\u201d Overall toxic environment. While I understand a lot of what I experienced as an employee gave me insight in a small and very specific scope, seeing things happen to my fellow coworkers made me feel helpless and stuck in what amounts to a dead-end job. There is so much cronyism and bro-culture at the office I worked, it was difficult to get through the day sometimes. There were a lot of back-patting promotions that occurred during my tenure there, even after it was formalized with interviews for said positions. There were also demotions and firings for nothing more than speaking your mind. If you are outspoken and raise concerns about how you or others are treated, a target will be placed on your back. You\u2019ll be seen as negative and they will be very skeptical of you moving forward, so much so they may make you feel like nothing is going to change and it\u2019s your fault. They will also begin to try to break you down. This is the culture of Squarespace. I was hired when there was a fun, startup mentality. We all had each other\u2019s back and there was camaraderie and excitement in what we were doing and the goals we were working towards. Fast forward to now, the culture is toxic and paranoid as I\u2019ve illustrated in the paragraphs above. But it doesn\u2019t even scratch the surface. Some people have had to go into therapy because of the mistreatment they received at the hands of management and executives. Moving out of retail, Squarespace seemed to be a logical step towards getting into web design, with it\u2019s slick templates/themes, hipster-cool employees, and museum quality downtown offices. Don\u2019t be fooled by their slick presentations and misleading promises to you during hiring. They will wave these in front of your face and hope you won\u2019t follow up if extended a hiring letter. These promises will quickly evaporate and you\u2019ll be stuck in a job that isn\u2019t better than the retail job you left or the call center job you didn\u2019t sign up for. Once the \u201cKool-Aid\u201d wears off and you see what it\u2019s really like, you will feel like you wasted your time. Advice to Management I know you won\u2019t listen to this review. Though I wish you would. If you do end up listening to what I have to say, I\u2019ll leave with this: take a hard look at what you are doing and creating in the cities where Squarespace has offices. You pride yourselves on having a good reputation as being a great place to work, sadly your reputation is taking quite a beating not only in Portland, but also in Dublin and NYC. You still have time to fix this though. Take Squarespace back to when the core values meant something (all the way back in 2013). Definitely don\u2019t stonewall your employees if things are less than \u201cawesome\u201d and they have concerns that they vocalize to you. Anthony, you need to pay attention to what is happening in Customer Ops and especially what\u2019s happening in the Portland and Dublin offices. People are not happy and not staying. Your best and brightest are leaving for anything they can get their hands on. Some have even gone back to retail. The huge reason employees leave a company isn\u2019t necessarily the company itself, they leave managers and supervisors first and foremost. Second only to the huge workload and high expectations you are placing upon your employees. I\u2019d agree that the push towards quantity over quality is not sustainable and you are going to continue to burn out batches of intelligent and motivated people because of this. They are basically giving up their lives for your product and your company, it would be wonderful to offer them something worthy, valuable, and your utmost respect in return.", "rating": 3, "pros": "Decent salary for post-retail work, though most perks are written into your salary package so it sounds like you\u2019ll earn more when signing on.", "cons": "No time to learn new initiatives nor time to really get a good idea of the product if something new is added.

At times the new initiatives when deployed break the platform or cause other issues. It doesn\u2019t seem like they tested these deployments thoroughly before making them public. As a customer service agent, you\u2019ll need to grow a thick skin due to developers inability to take constructive feedback, answer customer complaints, and constant need to stroke their ego. Be prepared to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Squarespace doesn\u2019t do that\u201d frequently. Feature requests up the chain do absolutely no good. They aren\u2019t read nor ever acted upon, they are merely a way to placate the customer.

Some of what I'm about to say is relevant only to the department in which I worked and does not necessarily apply to the company as a whole. However, some of it does. The spirit of collaboration is dead here. While autonomy can be nice in that there is no micromanaging - you are simply trusted to just do a good job - the reality is that Its largely every person for themselves. If you want to learn anything and grow \"you gotta steal it.\" (as stated repeatedly by upper management.) Opportunity and advancement seems somewhat arbitrary \u2013 with some people working for over a year at levels well above their title or what they were being paid for and others being hired or promoted for positions in which they had close to zero experience (including positions in management.) Obviously this is not across the board, but when it comes to hiring management, one bad decision can (and did) cause significant inertia in critical areas where the company shouldn't have been falling behind. Equally as arbitrary is how they choose to deal with sexual harassment. (Not implied, subtle undermining, mind you, but blatant, public, verifiable acts.) Over the course of a few years there were a handful of firings for this kind of misconduct, but there were also exceptions that involved a mere slap on the wrist. The distinction was seemingly based on whether the employe had established their value to the company as a worker. That is - if you're talented, hard working and generally good at your job, you're more likely to get away with it. And some have. Like other prominent tech companies, there seems to be a bit of wiggle room in the so called Zero Tolerance Harassment Policy. If the recent TechCrunch article is any indication, (\"Uber is Not the Only Company That Mishandles Sexual Harassment Claims\") Squarespace has proven that it is sadly on par with the tech industry in this respect. After one such public allegation, HR did a lengthy presentation addressing issues of diversity and harassment in which it reiterated its policies and stated that they are a \"safe place\" for any employee to come and speak honestly. However, the truth is that they are there to protect the interests of the company first and foremost. This became clear when on each of the two times I brought up my discomfort about an employee who had not been dismissed after publicly harassing a colleague, my concerns were received with something between well maneuvered neutrality and politically necessary indifference. That said, Squarespace is not altogether a bad place. When I started, the true spirit of a start up was still intact; It was clear that the people there were driven by the desire to innovate and do their best work \u2013 a genuinely exciting and fulfilling environment to be in. It could be said that it has merely encountered the common tipping point in the growth curve where principles take a back seat to politics and integrity rapidly degrades.

If you're any further in your career and think working for a tech company may be beneficial to your development, please see below. Cons I applied for work here when the Portland office was opening, lured by the promise of getting in on the ground floor of a new office for a growing company. However, this office is a complete dead end, as Squarespace's customer care is run like another, separate company within the company. There's no room to move up. New positions within customer care are few and far between, and most management positions are given to outside hires. A title and role change doesn't mean a pay raise, and since customer care is constantly reshuffling and restructuring, what used to be your own separate role will suddenly become something baked into everyone else's job. When I began, for example, the transition from email to live chat came with a pay raise, and only if you elected to pursue it. Now it's been shuffled in as a standard responsibility for everyone in customer care. Sadly, I was moved to live chat during that shuffling, so my job completely changed under me and I saw no compensation. I would not have elected to do live chat if given the choice, but unfortunately I was the last person with any opinion on my career at Squarespace. Pay raises are nominal, infrequent, and matched by incoming employees' base salaries, leaving tenured, hardworking employees with nothing to show for their efforts and time. It's clear management is ill-equipped to support the needs of their employees; they don't share the workload and are mainly there to babysit you and feed you the company line. When you've spent an hour taking abuse from an irate winery owner who's unable to log into their account because they've had their caps lock on the whole time, it can be quite lousy to have to sit down with your supervisor and be told how you could've possibly ended the interaction sooner, or how you could've been more cheerful in your responses. The moment you stop drinking the Kool-Aid, things go downhill fast. Advocate for yourself and you'll just put a target on your back. Often the benefits are thrown back in your face; on multiple occasions, mentions of unfair treatment or untenable changes were met with a reminder that we get free lunch or \"unlimited\" PTO. I've heard stories as well as seen firsthand people have their place in the company threatened for asking inconvenient (but valid) questions in \"ask me anything\"-style meetings. Many would call this retaliation. Customer Care is the first point of contact for customers, and the furthest away from any actionable change. You'll tire of hearing the same basic shortcomings of the platform and fielding suggestions that cannot possibly be implemented. You'll soon tire of submitting feature requests or bug fixes, as you know most of them fall on deaf ears. There's an utter lack of ongoing product training after onboarding, and as the platform and internal policies are eternally shifting, you can ask three people the same question and get three answers that were right at one point or another. Features and integrations are constantly implemented and live tested without warning. Sometimes you'll be informed of a change through a backdated email, or when a customer reaches out with an issue about said change, leaving you scrambling for an answer on the fly. This leads to an aggressive in-house apathy where advisors just try to push emails and chats through as fast as possible without actually *solving* the problems customers present. Management doesn't keep promises and benefits are slowly being scaled back. Open communication is mainly lip service; management will say \"we're looking into it\" when a valid issue is brought up and then never readdresses the issue. Often you're told to come up with a project to solve an issue that's beyond your authority to address. Other times, you'll be asked for \"actionable feedback,\" which is another way of shrugging off staff concerns and gaslighting you into thinking nothing's going to change, and that it's your own fault things haven't. Most of the perks are in place a) because that's where the tech-world bar's been set and b) to maintain the company's image. There's a reason the office is smack-dab in the middle of downtown Portland; Squarespace wants to be seen as cool and vital, even though they're just running a call center. The hip, sleek office is actually quite sterile and unfriendly, especially as we were discouraged from hanging anything on walls. There's an eerie paranoia surrounding allowing visitors or the general public to see what it looks like inside. The \"open\" office environment means no privacy or personal space. Team Leads and advisors who aren't yet in chat make distracting levels of noise, leaving you feeling like a curmudgeon for having to focus on your concurrent chats. Personal space isn't respected, and often you'll come in to find your chair readjusted or straight-up missing, and personal items on your desk broken or missing. Some of this you can turn a blind eye to and possibly abide a lot earlier in your career. However, it'll wear you down sooner rather than later, especially chat, where KPIs are unrealistic, as has been admitted by management (but of course, nothing's been done about it). Based on the direction things had been taking in the two years I'd worked there, it's only bound to get worse. Advice to Management I'm not sure there's much I can say that won't go unheard. I've spoken up about these concerns as your employee and your actions have spoken volumes about your lack of interest in anything other than the Bottom Line. Talented, innovative people are jumping ship for really anything else they can get their hands on. Maybe the next batch of hires won't notice the problems as you stabilize, but I doubt it, as I still hear stories about constant shuffles and restructuring.

Good step for those transitioning out of retail into office culture. Typical tech/startup company window dressing (free meals, snacks, etc.), but this is already the standard at most tech companies. I'm genuinely a fan of the product. Cons Other negative reviews here accurately reflect life in Customer Care in great depth, so just to echo similar points: - Management is self-serving and ill-equipped to do their jobs. Upwards feedback is deflected. Managers goof around with nerf fights and other distractions while agents are too busy. If you do provide valid and constructive feedback, be ready to be lectured on how grateful you should be that they provide free lunch and snacks. - Drink the office Kool-Aid if you want to get anywhere. I get it, every office has its politics, but Squarespace has it dialed up to 11. I've seen quality employees get overlooked in favor of company cheerleaders who spend more time playing ping-pong than working. - Little to no growth opportunities from entry-level CC positions. - No innovation in CC. Management doesn't care to hear it from agents. - For all intents and purposes, CC is separate from the rest of the company. Don't bother hoping to move elsewhere, or at the very least get an opportunity to learn from and to collaborate with members in other departments. Yes, some CC agents have been promoted to the mothership, but that was a long time ago and the org is just too big now. - Inadequate training, and when you are struggling, leadership throws you shade and makes you feel incompetent. It's a lot of the old guard spouting lines like \"well I didn't have this training when I started and I could do it so why can't you?\" - My role changed to one with added responsibility but without a pay raise. The thing is, I've had jobs I've liked way less. It's a better than retail as far as the day-to-day is concerned, but the Squarespace culture is just so toxic. Their presence on Crain's Best Places to Work is compelling, but keep in mind companies have to submit themselves to be eligible and acceptance is based on evaluations submitted by employees.

The customer care department is one of the most dedicated teams I've worked with, but the sheer expectations of management will lead you to be overworked and burnt out very quickly. You're put into teams and assigned to a team lead, who just consistently micro manage you. You can't really blame them as this is all in the hands of upper management. If you're more of an independent worker, then this place isn't for you. Be prepared to get reprimanded if you're not meeting or exceeding your metrics. Everything is a competition. Recognition is great, but to boast about certain people exceeding expectations isn't encouraging at all, and it tends to make people feel worthless, and things like this often leads to favoritism. Also note that you will apologize to customers a countless number of times for features that the platform doesn't have because the product is severely lacking. I've learned of so many creative ways to say sorry to customers. The customer care team is incredibly huge, over 200 employees, which makes up the majority of the company. With that being said, there is zero room for growth. I've been with the company for three years, and never had the opportunity to show my true talents, even though you have the chance to contribute to other speciality teams, you're left to do the grunt work. I've literally been told that Squarespace may not be the place for me by one of my supervisors, and that I should consider another job because of this. Seriously. When I first started, this was a true start up and a very close, tight knit community. Forget about that now. No one speaks to each other, and overall the team is very \"clique-ey\" Products and changes will be released with little notice. On top of this, you don't really get to learn the product because you're answering chats and tickets all day. How are you expected to be productive and have a steady workflow when you know nothing about the product, or things are sprung on you last minute. Management has a BS open door policy. They urge you to bring up concerns and ideas. However, if those don't match to the opinions of management, then again, you just made yourself a target. I've learned that some of my colleagues have been terminated for speaking up about the rampant favoritism that goes on here. While the benefits are amazing, you're left to feel extremely over worked and under paid.

You're underpaid, held to arbitrary metrics that can change without notice, and despite claims to the contrary, your career won't go anywhere unless you manage to luck out. But don't expect that to happen to you. Once upon a time it was a pretty fun place to work at, and it even felt like a stereotypical tech company job that you see on TV where it had a fun and loose atmosphere. However the company started growing faster than it could support, in part thanks to the multi-million dollar advertising campaigns, and the area that suffered the most was the customer support end. But suddenly the focus shifted from email to live chat because this was allegedly the hot new thing for customer support trends. The smiles began to fade as the environment became more like a depressing computer farm, where many advisors were either struggling with their product knowledge (since you rarely receive any additional product training after you hire in, including updates/changes that you are never informed of because advisors are not important) or making creative apologies for the platform's numerous bugs or missing features. And when it comes time for your compensation review, don't count on much more than getting bumped up to the current pay that incoming advisors will get due to the cost of living increase. Your seniority and projects will play no part in your comp review despite possibly being mentioned as they go over your year, as the focus will only be on your live chat metrics. Also don't expect a Christmas bonus or any other kind of thank you for your year of hard work. Don't like it? Don't speak up about it, because all you're doing is putting a target on your back and sooner or later there will be an excuse to get rid of you. This is the work environment we're currently dealing with, and the amount of paranoia the managers currently have means that it's pretty likely that this whole house of cards will come down on itself in an ugly way. For a company that spends millions of dollars on advertising themselves as a \"creative\" and easy platform, they sure don't bother sharing any revenue with their employees who work significantly harder. Once you're in it's harder to get out because of the steady paycheck and benefits, so do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. Don't degrade yourself, don't apply to Squarespace. Advice to Management There's absolutely zero point in providing any advice, since you aren't going to listen anyway despite the \"open door\" policy.

It'll seem like a dream come true for the first 6 months with free lunch, but once you see how everything really is behind the fake happy front everyone puts up you'll be pretty miserable. Overall, the company acts fairly egotistical and doesn't seem to care much about customer feedback. Those bug reports you'll be filing and the feature requests you'll be submitting will most likely be ignored by engineering. You'll spend most of your days in three Live Chats at a time giving workarounds for features that should be there and making excuses for shortcomings in the product. In Portland, the company has zero presence in anything related to the local tech community. When some employees spoke up to management about this, they were given many excuses as to why this was the case all while painting Squarespace as still caring about contributing to the local tech community. There was also the topic of diversity brought up multiple times by different employees. Even though management says they care about diversity, I still see tons of caucasian hipster-like new hires in their 20s. Actions speak louder than words. You're expected to dedicate your entire life to working at Squarespace and if you want to do anything outside of work (including volunteering), you need to sign a form and get approval from legal. If you don't fill out the form and they find out...that's an offense that could get you terminated. The main downside to dedicating you entire life to Squarespace is the fact that there are no growth opportunities. Customer Care is so large that it is run as a separate company within the company, so there is little conversation and few ways to bridge into working in other departments. This also applies for individuals that have the skills to work in another department. The training team is out of touch with the product and teaches incorrect things, so you're essentially thrown into the queue unprepared and stressed out. All of this is happening while managers still gaslight you that there are opportunities and that you're just not working hard enough to prove that you deserve something more. Unless you have a stroke of luck, they'll most likely end up just shoulder tapping someone who plays the politics game better than you or hiring an external candidate. They expect people to go above and beyond, yet offer little incentive to do so. Even the salary is not very comparable given the rising rents in Portland. That is another thing that was brought up and ignored by management/HR. I've heard stories about people getting a promotion, yet never got a raise for that promotion until their comp review...which was months later. Overall it seems like a game to see how much more they can get you to do, without compensating you any more. If you don't like it...don't speak up. Management will put a target on your back and try to come up with any excuse as to why your argument is incorrect in an attempt to silence you by threatening your job. Once upon a time this was a great office environment, but now management/HR rules by making people afraid of losing their jobs. The open door policy is a joke. Overall, it's great for a first time job and resume builder since the outside community doesn't quite realize how awful this company is yet, but if you still decide to accept a job here don't expect anything more than another bullet of experience on your resume. Oh also free lunch too. Advice to Management My advice to Mr. Casalena. Please keep an eye on what's happening in your remote office.

My advice to the PDX Customer Operations \"leadership\" team: people work for Squarespace because they really believe and care about the company.

It's a product that empowers and enables it's users to focus on their craft and to not sweat the minutia; like building out your online presence. The CEO, I'm a little torn on this one. Ultimately I'm a big fan of Anthony's, I think he has a built an incredibly successful product and has a passion for the business he's created. However why I default to a neutral opinion on him is this; the culture failure in Customer Operations as a whole and particularly PDX ultimately falls on him as the head of this company. Catered lunch Monday-Friday? (Just kidding, that's factored into your overall salary and monetized in your offer letter) Cons Unlimited PTO: Unlike traditional PTO accrual you have \"unlimited\" or the now phrased \"flexible\" PTO. Unlimited sounds like a solid deal until you examine the way Squarespace handles this benefit. Traditional PTO are hours you've earned and by most reasoning exist as your own actual income. With Unlimited PTO you have no accrual, hence no cash out if you leave the company, cap out on hours; not the biggest of gripes overall. The big clincher is the clause Squarespace provides with the PTO: *Within the needs of the business. This phrase is rather benign and does not raise any red flags immediately but be aware that your request for PTO is based off of a 1 person per team (13 or so people) per day, another restriction that takes precedent is an overall cap for the office, and as you may have guessed by now that cap is below 1 person per team. Finally your now \"flexible\" PTO is actually managed at around 2 weeks of PTO per year, congratulations on being as competitive with time as my first job bagging groceries. Summary: Unlimited PTO sounds great, but you won't likely be able to use it much. Career Opportunities: Here I will only be able to speak to Customer Operations in Portland, Oregon. It's pretty simple. You will likely never advance into another role aside from the one you're hired for. If you do, you won't get a raise until your next review cycle (once a year), this may or may not take into account your new role. That last statement probably sounds weird, well it's because it is. Squarespace has a \"solely performance\" based compensation structure. This means you will only ever be up for compensation review once a year, changing roles does not impact this. Almost forgot, compensation reviews have a possibility of a 0% increase, even for those far below a compensation cap. Summary: You likely will never advance if you work in the Portland, OR office (strictly Customer Operations), if you are one of the few, you will not be compensated for it; possibly for an entire 6-12 months. Senior Management: I'd love to protect my anonymity so I won't say a lot. Summary: Let's call it an area of opportunity Work/Life Balance: This one will likely be met with some immediate, \"But it's great right now!\". Squarespace has a goal of expanding Live Chat coverage to be 24/7. As with previous support structures such as email, Customer Operations in Portland will cover the hours of 8am-12pm PST. Be aware, you will work weekends and you will work late night shifts; maybe not now, but you will. Summary: This is a support center for a 24/7 support structure, your schedule is dictated by demand, end of story. Culture and Values: Apparently Squarespace scores a 4.4 out of 5 at the current juncture. Senior management will regularly encourage everyone to fill out Glassdoor reviews and surveys around high points of the year and while they enter various workplace popularity contests. Exit paperwork includes quite the legal talk about why you can't and shouldn't say anything negative about the company; I'm no mathematician but 4.4 makes a lot more sense now. The Way Things Were: This one will arguably sound very whine-y; I believe it's worth noting for a company that has grown more fiscally prosperous quarter over quarter. There are employees who joined this company during a time where annual boat cruises to celebrate with your team happened, holiday gifts were given, standing desks were provided for employees looking to avoid a completely sedentary work life. I do indeed know these are nice to haves and they were great, they were also monetized in your offer letter and a huge part of the culture and reasons you could feel invested in and valued. These things will likely continue to dissipate over as time goes on. Summary: As the company scales, these things will change. \"Scalability\u201d is the name of the game. Don't be fooled. Squarespace Portland is not an innovative startup with a similar culture, it is a corporate support center. Quantity is #1 as the KPI to rule them all. Compensation: Entry level support positions pay roughly the same as some of the more established coffee shops and retail establishments in town. Summary: If you're a single debt free individual you may just be able to afford a studio in Portland city proper on entry level wage. Benefits: There is no public transit stipend, because according to Squarespace, no one offers this benefit; well other than every other tech company on the west coast, but I digress. No fitness reimbursement, so expect to run your butt off on your own dime after sitting in the same spot taking live chats for 9 hours a day, according to Squarespace no other tech companies offer this benefit as well, oh wait, except every other tech company on the west coast, but I digress. Your health, vision and dental is paid by Squarespace; vision is standard VSP, health and dental are the worst plans I have ever had. Be prepared to pay around $2,000 out of pocket for surgical procedures like tonsillectomies and wisdom tooth extractions with this coverage. Comparatively at my previous employer, both of these would have been covered at a 100% or an out of pocket expense of less than $200. Work from home can sometimes be an expectation of your job as well, they offer no partnership or subsidy for internet costs. Summary: Vision is standard, health coverage sucks, dental coverage sucks, no fitness reimbursement, no internet subsidy/partnership, no public transit subsidy. Benefits are paid by employer however.

Cons Team Leads should not always be agents that performed in an excellent way. They should also be humans. Let me explain: micromanaging your team makes them feel anxious, feel that they are not enough, that they're the stupid person in the team. At first you don't say anything to anyone, but then you realise that this is a behavior applied to many people. Little by little they lower your self steem, and there many, many hypocrites in management of control positions over the agents, so there is little to do when it comes to ask for help. Because, in order to remain in their positions, they support each other and people are afraid to stand up for their rights, so you can see many people feeling miserable, but until they realise that they can go somewhere else and feel better and sometimes with even a better salary, it takes some time. It's like a toxic relationship. They make you feel as if you want to belong to a group, to the popular group, to the main mafia that has been working there for a long time and go choosing between the newcomers to make the net bigger. The issue here is that this group of people and their \"management skills\" have resulted in many people leaving the company in the last year. I'm talking about more than 20 people. And don't think that their hiring enough people to replace them. They just command those who stay to work more, and in worse conditions - the holidays are not as flexible as they say, new shifts until 10pm, which makes extremely difficult to have a good balance between your personal and work life. Even people who were loved by most of the agents have left the company. And without any real reason from management. Making everyone feel insecure because even the greatest people ended up having crisis due to the company. Advice to Management It's not all about numbers, think about the people in the company, you've hired a bunch of people whose ethics and morals are some of the worst I've ever seen in my life. And value some agents who are always helping, both morally and at work and are not really valued. Also, I've seen many people advised that they were going to work in their own language. That actually never happened. Although in their role description it said so. Also, as soon as language experts were chosen, people who have no idea of punctuation or grammar in their own language were hired for those positions because of their numbers as agents instead of their background.

Cons I will list my full experience below: CONTRACT: Lack of transparency. It says 'flexible holiday', but the first week I started working I found out, that they'd prefer me not to take holiday within the first 4-6 months until the training is finished, and you cannot pick the day you want you can only choose from what's left on the list. These means that when you join the company, you get to see the calendar that is pre-booked until the end of the year and you grab what's left. Three times within the last 9 months I tried to get 3 days off, and it was impossible, because a) you're still in training b) you need to become an expert ASAP, and you need to focus on this goal c) there are no slots available. THREE days off in this company is big problem. Sometimes volumes are very low, you have nothing to do, no one allows you to take a project either. I asked twice, I came up with the projects, and both times I was denied, because I 'needed to focus on becoming an expert asap'. Once I asked my manager for help, saying that I really need him to approve 3 days of holiday, could you please make an exception since the volumes are low? And what I received was a question:'Why do you think you deserve an exception?\" Because I am a human who needs rest, I am not a robot! Holiday policy was never explained prior to signing the contract, it was revealed only a week after I started. SHIFTS: They still change weekly, and you'd work anything between 7am and 10pm! I cannot combine work and sport activities, the classes I want to take are in the evening so half of them I miss. And you can barely swap the shifts. Before I signed the contract I asked if I could combine work and evening studies, and was told that this shouldn't be a problem, and I could swap shifts if needed. Isn't the case! My manager told me if the classes are not tech related, they are in conflict with my work. So my personal development was not valued at all! I was very disappointed to hear that. Plus, for each shift, lunch and meeting you need to clock in and clock out online, this makes you live by the clock. You cannot be late EVER. I never been late for work more than one minute within the last 9 months! I am not saying it's good to be late, I am saying I developed an internal fear of being late more than a minute. MANAGEMENT: Mostly very young, with lack of experience people. My manager lives by the management book and it's really easy to put him off by asking a thought provoking question. It often feels if this is not in the book, he cannot answer it and struggles to phrase a constructive answer. Many people who were hired for a specific language, ended up working in English, because for years they are not able to launch support in other languages. And there is a lot of micromanagement. You always feel like you're been controlled and not trusted, I often have to write in the sheet what resources I've been checking for the last hour in order to improve my performance. How many minutes it took and what I learned. I feels like being back to school. CAREER: No development plan, no options to grow. Many people who worked here for years always remained just admins, you have nowhere to move really. And important to add, you stop learning after 6 months, you're done with training and there are no new challenges in front of you, you do the same things and deal with the same topics daily. Maximum you can do, run a global meeting or initiate one project that you will never be given enough time for. LIVE CHAT: Now we work primarily in Live Chat. Parallel to that you're expected to take tickets! Double work and multi-tasking. It's really really exhausting. We have no time to go to the toilet, sometimes you have to run while awaiting for a customer's answer in the Live Chat. Sometimes you don't have such chance for an hour or two if the customers are really intense! You cannot go to the toilet for an hour! It's ridiculous! It's unhuman. Think of females, please! Even in prison they can go to the toilet whenever they want! This way the company kills more volume using the same amount of people. Smart move, but shows that the admins are treated like robots, not humans. Advice to Management Re-work your shifts, be more transparent about the conditions before one signs the contract. Please be more human, listen to your admins, don't turn them into robots, there are pregnant women on the floor! People need time for personal life, people need to know they have 25 days of holidays yearly, they need to be able to take those days, not to fights or bag for at least 20! Consider hiring external staff, outsource weekend and late shift work. Don't stay by excuses that it is hard to train the people outside, find the way, outsource training and support too if needed. Hire more professional team leads, who have years of experience, not those who went to a conference or read a management book.

The company opened in Dublin with the idea of expanding the platform in Europe. They've failed at that, due to lack of planning, zero marketing and of course the fact that the platform and help site isn't translated into other languages. The service is too expensive for most customers - excepting those in the US, I guess - and taking that into account it's impossible that it will ever grow in LA countries and most European countries at such expensive rates. If you're a bilingual person and would like to work in your native language, Squarespace isn't the place for you. You'll be working exclusively in English. Also, no chances to grow internally. Most leadership positions are filled with external professionals - almost all team leaders, HR and the two managers were hired externally. When I left, I had actually been in the company longer than all team leaders and managers. How weird is that. Also, lots of favouritism, finger pointing and back stabbing.

Furthermore, you have the opportunity to work on your own projects, do training courses and life lab sessions. Also, no micro managing! If you prove you are responsible and invested in your projects (and the company), you are given trust and autonomy to organize your own work. The salary is competitive and the benefits are great: free lunch, kitchen full of snacks, paid time off, medical insurance, regular pay upgrades etc. Although the company is fast growing it is doing a great job of retaining its original startup culture and atmosphere, and it's proven that it listens to employee concerns.

I warn you the list is long(er), honest (many former of SS Dublin will certainly agree) - Incompetent senior management team ==> Many have been recruited as TL (internally) only by politics, favoritism. They are simply lacking experience, humanity, respect, competence and experience to be in the shoes of a lead. The only one that are standing out of the pack are the lead recruited externally, as we can feel they have been leads in a different environment where KPI's where certainly a more human, realistic and respected approach of the management was practiced. They start with a good spirit (at the beginning) and quickly develop an egotistic approach at the contact of the new management that are imposing them to micro manage (they know everything, they have seen everything in the industry... no need to feed you more on that). Retain the keyword: MICRO MANAGEMENT This is their new crusade, as they are convinced that this is by following every single people's movements they will become more productive and responsive than similar companies on the market. Wrong. Everything changed between the moment I started. The old office was at Benson Street, with the Grand Canal Dock spirit and atmosphere. It felt like a real startup where changes, development, growth were possible. They quickly arranged themselves (voluntarily or not) to clean what was great to replace it by the worst... When things turned sour and bitter was the transition to the new location in Great Ship Street, Le Pole House where the office is now located. Decisions are made and done behind curtains (a lot), one thing is announced and will never see the light of the day. We then saw a massive growth of the team (which should be positive when properly handled... but wasn't). Then some projects were continuing to develop (or not), applied a week as pilot, removed the week after, No structure, proper guidelines leaving the Shift Leads (Supervisors) empty handed, with issues to guide us in the queues. They are testing things like amateurs. Not even Facebook are running pilots this way. . Important aspect to underline here, they divided the leads in 2 parts: Team leads and Shift Leads. Those helping us in the queues, answering our questions (any, and they were fantastic at this) were them, leaving the Team Leads doing just 1:1 and doing their shenanigans in the back with a minimum of interactions with us on a daily basis. The sad result of this is obviously having no visibility on what we really do and judging us through metrics that are not even reliable (internal tools breaking reflecting different numbers one week and another). We have been initially hired because of our language to support other markets... almost 2 years later... and still going, no support in other languages. They are supposedly working on an international expansion but the support for the english speaking market is still not yet fully secured. This aspect comes back naturally to incompetency. Reminding that the company is already more than 10 years and yet NO international support. Naturally the pressure of the investors might be knocking hard(er) to get results. - Growth and development ==> Inexistent. As I mentioned, the oldest that arrived first had eventually a chance to get a bone or some left overs, for the new guys, you are hired as Customer Advisors and will stay in that role. If you ever try to step up, lead some projects, present at the local team meeting, or even request to apply for an internal position (when it is posted), regardless of what you do best, you will never have a chance to progress EXCEPT if you are the buddy of a team lead, shift lead or a manager. The number of people who progressed just by being best friends of somebody in the management is countless. The word for this is FAVOURITISM or POLITICS. You will tell me that they exist everywhere but in Squarespace Dublin this is the HQ for such practices. - Work/Life Balance ==> Expect to work shifts between 7am and 8pm. Not the same from one day to the other one. Changing without warning when an event comes (advertising campaigns in the US = change of your schedule with just 48h prior warning. Do they know people have lives? Families? Responsibilities outside of this company? No! 2016 and still no improvement. Once you get your shifts for the quarter there are no turnarounds, take it or leave it as I have heard being said once. They will expect to constantly move between channels when their new Channel Leads are sneezing. I have seen people doing full day in chats and forced to keep 2 concurrent chats and being denied to run to the toilets. They had to even make public meetings about the problems. As it has been highlighted in previous reviews, they give you a treat (ice cream) and the minute after they announce you they will change your schedule. Beware of the treats they are made to make you swallow the worst. - Culture and values ==> Well, we went from a startup that used to praise unicorns and rainbows to a place that looks like to hell. Not sure how the other offices are run in Portland and New York, but after previously outlining what i said above, not sure there is much left of a culture and values. When people are being let go for nothing, when the respect of the people who are contributing to the growth of this company is not recognized (not speaking of a new absurd system to recognize \"stars\"... next step, they will give people vouchers or lollipops). Useless local meeting that are constantly changing, not regularities, empty content (oops the monkey, where you are supposed to tell to the whole assembly your oops moment of the week, and if you win, you keep on your desk a non washed monkey). There was a culture before, when all the best people started the things (for CFO, former customer office Manager... well in fact all the people they pushed outside to hire instead people from Google in the top management team to \"clean\" the place as it seems the good couldn't stay. It breaks my heart to write this review as I really thought I found with Squarespace the company I would spend a lot of time with, but the venture of Squarespace in Dublin is the perfect example on how great things can turn wrong for any company settling in a different country. There was a real care about the people who joined this \"famunity\" as they called it at the start, and then quickly the things turned to be sour and bad to the point where I saw people preferring to leave and ready to take a cut in salary for other people rather than staying in this place. Maybe it wasn't perfect at the start, maybe there wasn't a lot of benefits but there was warmth, people respecting each other, helping each other and having a passion of the products, all you can see now are people stuck with no chance to progress and prove they are do and accomplish things, they turn bitter and angry and end up making no efforts to stay. They end up being burnt out, tired and emptied of energy. Advice to Management Review in deep your organisation and structure to make sure Dublin gets the same chances Portland and New York seem to exhibit... after reading other reviews it seems the issue is the same... your best chance is to consolidate and fix the management methods before you launch the international support as it will break and the support will turn less than average.", "rating": 1, "pros": "as previously outined in other reviews, the standard most start up, fancy american companies are offering:", "cons": "Now the cons...

Breaks are controlled and lunch breaks are taken at a different time every day. Sometimes before lunch has arrived or when it's already removed. Lots of employees will rather have snacks or crisps as lunch is usually taken in front of your computer while working. Although this has been brought up, the company won\u00b4t make changes. I can't really understand how a good company will prioritize work volumes to your own health. Also, no chances to grow or develop a different role. The few employees who managed to evolve seem to get it through favouritism or cigarette-break friendship. Lots of brilliant employees with a great background and experience are left behind doing the same boring task day after day. Company has been expected to provide support in several languages for the last TWO years and most of the employees (around a hundred) were hired for this purpose. However, there's no transparency as to how this is going to happen and it keeps being delayed and foreign employees, who applied for a linguistic role in their native language, are ignored and have only been working in English since their first day. Working hours have increased over the last year, from 32 to 40h/weekly, while salaries didn't. Still, most of us were impressed by the free snacks, drinks and lunch, but this won't help once you start getting exhausted from the rotating shifts, repetitive tasks and no perspective of improvement. Company has fired several employees without notice and they're always asked not to mention the reasons, which leaves it to outside office gossip. Some of them had babies or a foreign visa. Company doesn't allow for employees to carry second paid jobs even if ocassional. A couple of employees were fired on the spot as soon as company found out they had a side job. If there's a concern or an issue, they will be ignored, delayed or replied with a reminder that our customers go first. I still remember the day we got free cupcakes first and then we received the news that we'd be working more hours weekly, with the same salary.
