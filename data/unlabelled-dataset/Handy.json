So which is it? If you work here, you are not working for a tech startup - you are working for a cleaning/janitorial company. Most jobs are in operations and support since Handy is a service business, which means you will spend hours each day emphasizing to poor English as a second language speakers that they need to clean underneath shampoo bottles, or getting yelled at by a customer because their shampoo bottles were not cleaned. Your salary will never increase. They hire mostly new college grads that are easily replaceable or outsourced. Allow me to repeat: this is not a place with opportunities to grow, this is a place to spend a year building experience and then getting out before you just can't take the entitled customers or cleaners who just don't care.

There's a free meal every shift, and snacks and soda. Although the soda is rationed because the staff was 'drinking too many.' You get a free Handy cleaning each month. And that's about it. Cons Seriously, where to begin. Handy Customer Experience team members are managed by sheer intimidation. The company provides free meals because there isn't time to go get food and come back and eat - and if you're a minute late, you'll be written up. Late to work? So are the managers, constantly. However, you do it and it's a write up. Which also usually comes with a healthy dose of being belittled by the management team, and goes as far as literally being screamed at in front of your teammates. They even log the time you spend going to the bathroom or getting a drink of water. Take too many? Drink less water and you won't have to get up as much... And if you don't? Layoffs. At least in the NYC HQ. Several rounds of public layoffs have occurred - and by public, I mean all the conference rooms are glass, so you literally get to watch the manager lay off your friends before your very eyes, then be escorted to the elevator. Because now that they figured out it costs half the price, all the jobs are being outsourced to call centers in Tampa and Arkansas. The workers there receive virtually no training, and constantly screw up customer accounts. But that bottom line, am I right? But then they go too far too fast -- fired too many people at once -- the hold times are often up to an hour on the phone, and 2-3 days via email. So then they beg you to stay for overtime, which is supposedly optional, but you are scolded if you wont stay extra time. There's also little to no coaching or scripts on how to handle situations -- the one manager who was attempting to build the training program left the second he got another job. (And good for him.) Everything is ruled by metrics - setting an unreasonable goal of interactions per hour which affect the level of customer service you can provide. Your goal is to get the person off the phone ASAP, with or without a resolution. Give the customer as little as you can get away with. Give the professionals as little as you can - purposely underpaying them in some circumstances for things to see if they notice. Handy is on no one's side but their own. When they switched the CX team from salary to hourly, they literally withheld half of every person's paycheck without any notice. Once it had already been done, an unapologetic email was sent by the lead manager, explaining why we weren't receiving our money. Many people struggled to afford their rents that month, as it was done on the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Meanwhile, the managers are sleeping with employees, drugs are rampant at company parties/keggers, which are often held in-office while the CX staff tried to work. One time, the two of those elements combined very publicly, if you know what I mean! That manager had to resign. And I had to repeatedly Lysol the couch. Great for the programmers and management to get their thrills, awful for the customers who literally are hearing a rave going on in the background of their phone calls. Because if the party happens during your shift? The work doesn't stop just because there's a DJ and multiple bartenders in the room! If you don't assimilate and party hard, you become a quick target, no matter your metrics. Bro culture at its epitome. The NYC CX crew is small at this point. Dozens were fired in the layoffs, but many more have quit and run, often without another job to go to, or by accepting a job with less pay. Because the thought of returning to that sinking hellhole and being yelled at by miserable customers, yelled at by professionals who you know fully well we're screwing over, and being yelled at by the managers who should be supporting you... just becomes unbearable. So take the previous reviews with a grain of salt about the sunshine and unicorns... like most of the reviews on the apps, they are either current management, social media team, or friends of employees they gave free cleanings to in exchange for a review. (I coordinated a few of these myself.) Stay far away from Handy CX if you value your personal integrity.

No, it is not a LUXURY to have a single co-worker. That is a basic part of working somewhere and it's really unfortunate that they expected me to feel privileged to have one person supporting me.

Cons Other reviews make it seem much, much worse than it is, but there is just a little truth behind them. 1) The company is growing very, VERY rapidly, so our office is pretty full during the day. It's clear we need more space, and we are moving this summer! 2) That being said, the office also can seem a bit cluttered, but not really disgusting/filthy. We have our own cleaning professionals come in 3 times a day to clean. The back pantry room has lots of boxes of snacks, beverages, and other pantry supplies stacked up, but that is because the ordering has to be done for so many people now, there just isn't room to put everything on the shelves. The only other solution would be for them to stop ordering the snacks for now, and I need my granola bars, so I don't want to see this happening! Also, the place is not \"roach infested\" as I saw mentioned in another review--the building does occasionally have a few cockroaches, and sometimes there will be one in the very back hallway by the trash room & freight elevator, which are not part of the main Handybook office. Even when there is the report of someone seeing just one, the managers are sure to not only let the building owner know, but they even call in and pay for exterminators on their OWN, on the company's dime, so that we don't have to wait for the sometimes unresponsive building managers and property owners to solve the issue. 3) Communication--this is nowhere near a hostile environment, and even reading that in a review startled me & made me hope that the person writing it has solved the personal issues they may have had with one or two other people, because that is just so crazy to hear. Right now since the team is so huge, there are days where you can feel like you are out of the loop on what is going on as far as where the company is heading, but they actively try to combat this by sending out update emails on what every team has and is doing, posting the quarterly initiatives on our team site, sharing links to what's being said about the company in the news, and having quarterly all-hands meetings, meaning everyone in the entire company. I know that communication is one of the most important things that will be focused on improving in the next few weeks, I think it was just rough for them to keep up with everything while we grew so fast, but you can tell they really want to make sure things are smoother going forward. 4) Again, goes with the fact that this company is experiencing tremendous growth--the founders clearly want to be approachable--they sit right in the middle of the office! Even though it is the noisiest & busiest area of the office and they would like to work in a more secluded & quiet area, I'm sure!

Be warned. -The heads of the company want to give the impression that they run a forward thinking, progressive company that works to improve the lives of their employees and the world at large, when it actually seems like it's run on old fashioned, corporate/Ivy League greed and apathy. And no, they do not care about employee burnout or turnover as the mindset is to treat employees as disposable commodity. You come, you go. Easy as that. Same attitude goes for their customers and their contract laborers who perform the actual jobs for them. -You think with this being a cleaning company that they would not have issues with keeping the office clean but yet they do! The garbage cans in the food/pantry area overflow with garbage at all times of the day which draws flies and other vermin. Food is often left out, uncovered, and/or left strewn all over the tables after the lunch rush. Oh, and the amount of food that goes to waste there; it's extremely shameful and sad given how many hungry people reside in this city. -They will lie to you during the interview process and tout the company as a great place to work with a ton of benefits and opportunity for mobility. No. They will bait and switch on you claiming that the nonsense taking place is all a part of the \"growth\" of the company. If you are silly enough to take a job there, expect little to no support or resources to successfully do your job. The only time management cares to acknowledge you is when sending intimidating emails about following/not following ambiguous company policies. I could go on all day about this place.

Unfortunately it doesn't extend to the broader company culture. Cons Higher ups in the company have a very cocky, entitled, and arrogant attitude, and tend play favorites amongst specific individuals within the company. This is a trend that has gotten increasingly worse as the company has grown. Expect to be micromanaged. Don't think that working hard will result in you getting acknowledged or rewarded. Initiative and taking ownership of a problem is more likely to increase your liability or get you reprimanded rather than get you any recognition (priorities are always on growth and doing things quickly rather than correctly). This is a company where if you put in 150%, you'll get 50% in return. As a result, employees (admittedly myself included) are motivated to care more about their individual numbers and and apparent performance rather than doing what's best for the company, customers, or contracted professionals. This issue is made much worse by the fact that people lower within the company are treated much more critically than those on top. Handybook has been very poor, bordering on unethical, in upholding their terms of the hiring contract. This is particularly true with respect to policies regarding vacation, overtime. Don't think that there's actually an open policy around vacation (although again, this depends on who you are and who you report to). The company has grown quickly, but unfortunately it hasn't grown well. As a result things are constantly broken and your ability to work effectively will be inhibited by factors completely outside of your control (software bugs, operational or communication backlogs, etc). Also, the office is EXTREMELY crowded, although to be fair management is working hard to sign a new lease so hopefully this will change in the near future. Finally, it's highly, highly likely that some of the five star reviews here are planted. Beware. Advice to Management Please be more ethical. Listen, communicate, and be more open and transparent to those within the lower ranks of the company. There's a LOT of opportunities for improvement across the company that wouldn't require a Harvard degree to recognize. Why put so much emphasis on hiring, but so little on retention?
