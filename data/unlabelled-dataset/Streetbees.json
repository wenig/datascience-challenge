The atmosphere is toxic, no decisions but hers matter and these are taken without input. The result is unfeasible projects being agreed to at too low a price and with too short a timeframe. Staff are expected to abandon all other activities to deliver, but feedback upwards about the business capabilities is ignored. The CEO is personally responsible for all the negative aspects of the business, but is enabled in this by the cofounder who is incapable of providing a moderating influence. Personal abuse is not unheard of, and management repeatedly have inappropriate conversations relating to individual performance loudly on the open floor. This contributes to the poisonous atmosphere.

Cons As several people have mentioned, Streetbees has a massive turnover of employees. Most people leave within 6 months (before their probation ends) and I even saw a few people leave after just a few days! It is a miserable and stressful place to work and so this turnover is not very surprising. The culture at Streetbees is one of fear and intimidation. This fear culture filters through all areas of Streetbees, from product development meetings all the way through to the CEO screaming at the interns on a Wednesday afternoon if the Deliveroo order turns up 1 minute later (literally) than 12:30. As an aside, I have no idea why the CEO goes crazy if the Deliveroo order arrives at 12:31, but she does go mad and watching a powerful CEO scream and shout at a group of interns over something so trivial is not pleasant. The CEO is by the far the worst person I\u2019ve ever worked with and is entirely responsible for the cultural and operational problems at Streetbees. The other co-founder is aware of the issues that exist, but is unable or unwilling to do anything about it. Meanwhile, lots of people continue to leave Streetbees each month and employee morale is always extremely low. Transparency isn\u2019t something that is valued, despite what the founders say. There isn\u2019t anything close to a collaborative or supportive working environment, there is little opportunity for organisational or individual learning and growth and it is absolutely not a fun or fulfilling place to work. Work/life balance is non-existent and project deadlines are ridiculous. You are expected to work late every single evening and on weekends. It got to the point where I felt like I needed to have my laptop with me wherever I went on the weekends, just in case I got that dreaded message from the CEO demanding something immediately. I could go on, but to summarise, working at Streetbees is relentless, miserable, stressful and thankless and my advice would be to avoid at all costs.

Startups are lots of hard work: but there is no sense of progress, and a toxic culture around expectation that make hard work at Streetbees unbearable. There is a massive fear culture: and it's hard because you feel like you're not _allowed_ to make mistakes. A lot of startups are about making mistakes and becoming stronger and growing as a business and individuals. In this company mistakes make you fear about your job. Many people left (at one time, it was 1 or 2 per week) because of the pressure, or because of mistakes they made being a cause for their termination. It feels like nobody is happy to be working at Streetbees. It really dampens the morale.
