Partners will back you if you have present a credible case. - Genuinely collaborative: This comes out in two ways, firstly business units do collaborate to try and build the right project team for each engagement. Secondly, unlike some other consultancies I feel like I could ask colleagues for help if I needed some advice or was struggling on any particular engagement, and not have it held or used against me. People want to see you succeed and this overrides most of the personal ambition/politics/agendas I've experienced elsewhere. It also encourages people to speak up rather than soldier on into situations they may not know how to handle. - Work Life Balance: In the context of consulting, Baringa makes much more than a token effort to help with this. I know that senior management and partners actively take into account personal situations (e.g. getting married, having a baby, etc) when staffing a client and will not fling someone out to the Outer Hebrides with 24hrs notice.

The work here is genuinely very interesting and the exposure to clients is at a much more senior level than at the same grade with my previous employer. The culture is more collaborative and more personal than what you would experience at most large consultancies. Recruitment Process The recruitment process was slick and accommodating. I was still at my previous workplace when contacted by Baringa and the recruitment team were friendly and informative. I went through two rounds of interview - the first with a Manager and SM, the second with a Partner. Before I started the process, I had an informal chat with an Energy Retail Director and was offered a peer-to-peer chat, which was very useful and all helped make my decision to move. The Work Throughout my career I have worked with major utilities and energy companies, but the work at Baringa has definitely been higher profile and personally more rewarding. In the last year and a half I have been providing direct assurance reports to the client programme director and C-suite, being given mandate to act on the remedial actions suggested and drive the change within these organisations. Internally Baringa are also great at providing opportunities to drive initiatives that take the company forward and help drive strategy. In my case, this has included shaping the direct recruitment campaign, heading up internal BU comms or work to identify key energy trends and their consequences for us as a business. The amount of internal work you get involved with is up to you, but the opportunity is definitely there with Baringa should you want it, irrespective of seniority! Culture The people we work with here really do make the company. I have never been refused a request for help or assistance, be that from peers or Partners of the company - it truly is a collaborative place. Working directly with Partners on client and internal engagements gives you levels of visibility and access to senior management that would be alien at larger consultancies. And it's not all about work - every year the company organise several company events, BU events and a trip away where spouses/family are welcome too. These events are great and you sometimes get the feeling the entertainments team are always trying to out-do previous events, which is fantastic!
