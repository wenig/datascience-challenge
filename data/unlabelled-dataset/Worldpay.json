They don't deliver dates and they are not accountable to anyone in order for new (to them; existing in the marketplace) solutions that their existing and prospective client base is demanding. They ignore emails and pawn things off to other departments. And the Product team is enormous. The new US Worldpay Total product is nothing but SecureNet witha new name. No new features. All emperor's new clothes. Like opening a box of air 2. Who's doing development on new products and existing infrastructure? Hell if I know. I know of 3. That's not standard for payments processor dev staff. Or any size of this operational structure. But make sure it's in SalesForce because that a major investment, again poorly implemented by head nodders and unnecessary meeting makers so they look good to the big guys. 3. Test and Production platforms do not mirror each other enough to ensure EMV certifications will work in the field. Not to mention how late in the game they were to get there. 4. Core teams who dealt with client EMV certifications were made up of \"boys\" with NO payment experience (terminals, merchant services, POS solutions) and we're yes men to the upper Super Egos. The sexist environment disallowed any experienced female to voice her opinion as she might emasculate these hot shot parrots. I saw horrific incidents where most places would have had security escort someone out the door for then way he spoke to several females. HR was never involved. 5. Product/Marketing team took personality tests and then all got together in a room to see \" who was what type.\" We kept charts in our mini cubes so we knew where they fell on the spectrum when dealing with them. Thousands on that silliness. 6. And the best - last CEO took all Senior leadership on a multi-million dollar \"Journey\" through Amsterdam and Europe to help them learn to work together. It ended on a yacht cruise on the Adriatic Sea. This is while the rest of us we're back dealing with a quagmire of nothing to sell and no dates. Money well spent - not.

If aren't producing and need help, good luck. I had a person on my team that was terminated because the sales manager thought they weren't working every day. The person was working because we would go out together, they just needed help. Good work ethic, but every time they reached out to their sales manager or corporate they either received wrong answers or they got 5 minutes. Sales manager was great, just put under a lot of pressure. Very frustrating if you are new and not from the industry. Compensation is very confusing. Even when it is explained 10 times, still doesn't click till you are there a year or so. Company is happy if you just figure everything out on your own, and not ask questions. Also, if you ask a question or complain, you will get cruicified. New hire training is horrible. I had enough when I called the support line to get information on a cost that is on the application, and the person on the other end couldn't even explain it to me and had no clue what it was.", "advice": "Don't pretend to be a company that cares about your growth and development, when you truly just care about people coming in and figuring it out by themselves.
