Being constantly challenged is really important to me in a role. The variety of data we work with and the wide client base means that the work can be quite varied, and it's easy to get involved in complex projects. There are obviously roles at Nielsen where you can do the same thing day in and day out for years, but there's also a lot of opportunity to grow if you look for it. 2) Culture. This is huge--probably the biggest reason I stay at Nielsen. Overall, the culture is very relaxed and meritocratic; people who are helpful, kind and engaged are the norm. The company truly recognizes and values from top-down everyone's achievements and individuality; I've never felt like a cog in the machine here, and I feel evaluated on merit, not my title or tenure. I really like the people I work with, too, not just on my immediate team, but more broadly. Nielsen hires a wide variety of people, but a common trait throughout (and encouraged through the culture) is being engaging and supportive. Net net, I look forward to coming into work every day. Cons Do I see myself leaving Nielsen someday? Possibly, yes, but it would be as a result of the company's health if they can't right the ship. For a self-titled \"technology company\", Nielsen leaves a lot to desired across multiple levels, which is frustrating because I want the company to do well. Developing measurement capabilities is incredibly difficult, and I don't want to understate that, but I wish we were pushing the gas pedal even harder on measurement capabilities. TV is dying; so, too, eventually will much of our revenue. If we can't get digital right, then Nielsen is going to become quickly irrelevant, and much of pro #1 is going to dissipate for me. Also, a huge con is that Nielsen is already suffering financially, with no immediate end in sight. Layoffs, reorgs, the mad scramble to hit impossible revenue targets-it gets wearying. There are a lot of reasons why Nielsen isn't doing well, but one area that jumps out at me and frustrates me to no end is our technology (beyond measurement). Some of our products are, well, terrible. If you have to hire people to pull reports for clients because your products are so hard to use (there are -many- teams that do just this), it's arguable whether money might be better spent on improving the product? Relatedly, even in my department alone, there are a ton of things that could just be straight-out automated. Why should someone spend a week on highly canned decks that can be populated by a script in less than a minute? When Nielsen considers how to trim the fat, there's plenty of fat in inefficiency that never seems to be trimmed and should be. Throwing people at problems that should really be solved with technology is a recurring theme and one we need to be careful of.", "rating": 5, "pros": "There are two main reasons why I continue to stay at Nielsen:", "cons": "Do I see myself leaving Nielsen someday?

No yearly pay raises. Constant and never ending reorgs (this was even before the crash). The \"every 9 month reorgs\" is an indictment on management that they have never found a winning formula that lets people get settled and establish a foundation in what they are doing. Once you hit a middle management level the political game gets crazy. Beyond that - they have a program called \"emerging leaders\" in which they groom kids straight out of college - and 2 years later - create and insert them into middle management jobs . Good for them -- but REAL bad for people who have been putting in years of work to try and get these positions -- pretty raw deal--- and it occurs EVERY SIX MONTHS! Dozens of new 20-somethings right into middle management. Right now - I'm taking ques from the top -- a few months ago after a MASSIVE round of layoffs the CTO and Global OPs leader quit out of nowhere --- so they know something....cant be good. We spent an entire year converting to AGILE methodology b/c this is the way the world is heading - and they just completely dismantled it with the latest reorg --- back to waterfall. They have a TERRIBLE identity crisis in which they would NEVER call themselves a tech company - in which case they might have to actually dedicate resources towards.....well.....resources. People quit all the time and the answer is always \"we can absorb this\" and spread those responsibilities to other people to take on (of course WITHOUT compensating) rather than backfill the position. They do not value employees at ALL and have let some truly brilliant and one of a kind people just leave without any attempts at retention.

If I can give it 0 star I would. To summarize, my time there was confusing and abused. These are a few of the major reasons I felt this way: 1. The entire time I was there, I felt my role was a complete redundancy and it made me question why they hired me in the first place. When I finally made a minor breakthrough in an assignment and was going to move onto a bigger piece, I received a linkedin recruiting message that used exact same words I used for my project. I was horrified receiving that because I felt unsafe. Not many people knew what I was working on at that point and for those that did I wouldn't have enough power to fight back. After that, I soon lost the tiny amount of support I received for the project - anyway it was already a conflict with another team from parent company. 2. I was interviewed for a senior role but upon receiving the offer it was the same role but minus \"senior\". My manager never talked to me about team visions and goals of my responsibilities. A month and 18 days after I was hired, our team had a first ever formal team meeting and I found I was the only one (of 7) that had no assignment from the priority list. When I questioned why I was put off the priority list, my manager said (these were the original words) \u201cyou can\u2019t just work on something you like (referring to the project in conflict with parent company)\u201d. But I was assigned to that work! 3. Situation became progressively worse towards end of October and early November. I felt being monitored. I started to receive company emails that had \"integrity issues\" in the titles whenever I met with a coworker in private or took a personal short break during the day. I also found my intranet connection to parent company (Nielsen) was disabled and IT failed to fix it for me. 4. I was of the same ethnical group with another employee in our team. I felt being put into an unseen competition with that person the entire time. But I didn\u2019t have the advantage. I was brand new to the company to the industry but the other person was with the startup (later acquired by Nielsen) for 5 years. As a result, my existence in any project became sensitive and coworkers including senior ranks started to avoid me. Because of this I couldn\u2019t learn properly the data and analytics system which was fatal to my work. 5. During the time I was at the company we moved to a newly renovated building. I, along with one other coworker, was seated right in front of two glass door conference rooms with real low cubicle walls. So as along as I sat in front of my computer and looked up I could see everything going on in those conference rooms and even their projected computer screens. This made me terribly uncomfortable combined with those \u201cintegrity issues\u201d emails because it made me think I was the target. 6. I had some idea for the product work I was working on at that time and after discussing with senior ranks it seemed to be leading somewhere. But I received very negative and open reaction from the person mentioned in point 4 and quickly lost all the support. It got so bad the last week I was with the company that I didn\u2019t feel safe to communicate with anyone through any channels. coworkers, especially those from my team, were avoiding me or avoiding to discuss work topics with me. I felt being framed to appear as an incompetent person while the reality was I was in an unfamiliar environment not being given guidance and learning opportunities. 7. There were many other things which I couldn\u2019t even finish counting. Based on my experience, I highly suggest anyone to look away from this company and work elsewhere to save yourself, your family and your life.
