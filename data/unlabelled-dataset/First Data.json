[{"title": "New First Data vs. Old First Data", "text": "Pros I\u2019ve been at First Data since 2014 and read Glassdoor reviews from time to time. They go back as far as 2008 and reflect the company\u2019s journey through a number of leadership changes since the 2007 leveraged buyout. The tumultuous period from 2007 to 2013, compounded by the global financial crisis, which particularly affected companies whose revenues are tied to consumer spending, stunted the company\u2019s growth. That all began to change in 2013 with the arrival of Frank Bisignano as CEO and the steps he\u2019s taken to transform the company, beginning with giving every employee stock in the company instead of a 401k match. Change isn\u2019t always easy, but in First Data\u2019s case, it was badly needed. Some colleagues who\u2019d been here well before Frank arrived didn\u2019t like that move because the stock, until our Initial Public Offering in 2015, was illiquid, like a startup equity you couldn\u2019t sell. That\u2019s all changed when FDC become a publicly traded equity again. We get annual equity grants that are equal to or better than a standard 401-k match, and the value of the stock has grown almost twice as much as the S&P year-to-date. This is a great deal for anyone who works here. And guess what? The deal is only going to get better because the payments industry is the place to be, and First Data is a strong bet on the future. If you look only at what the company has done this year, it\u2019s making strong moves to develop the right technology, innovation and talent to expand its industry leadership. The Clover team in Silicon Valley has come out with the fifth model of the Clover family. The acquisition of Acculynk is strengthening the company in debit processing. And the acquisition of CardConnect opens up a whole new world in our relationship with Independent Sales Organizations (ISOs) and Independent Software Vendors (ISVs). The future is bright indeed. And if anyone still thinks this remains the \u201clegacy First Data,\u201d take a look at how welcoming the company is to veterans and military families or the LGBTQ community. Diversity \u2013 of age, gender, orientation, and background is at the heart of an overall cultural uplift I\u2019ve seen over four years. The latest case-in-point? If you\u2019re an auto racing fan like I am, take a look at Kyle Larson, the millennial rockstar of NASCAR. He\u2019s proudly wearing the First Data name on his chest and putting it on his car, backed up by an extraordinary team and state-of-the-art technology, like the New First Data itself. Cons It takes a while for a company that's been around since 1971 to fully shed its old veneer, or its old attitudes. In my job I\u2019ve been to a number of First Data offices, and some are more contemporary than others. I know efforts are underway to modernize them, and these efforts need to continue. For the younger people here, they\u2019re adapting well to their surroundings. First Data may never be a place where the offices are lined with sofas and ping pong tables \u2013 though you never know what you might find in Silicon Valley \u2013 but the attitude and spirit, reflected in the energy that these software developers, engineers, project managers, and salespeople, are changing quickly. Over time, I\u2019m sure, the furniture and fittings of the office will change, along with the attitudes and outlook. But the accelerated pace and tempo of the New First Data may not be for everyone, and if some are used to a more 9-to-5 job or \u201cthe way things used to be,\u201d this may not be the place for them. Advice to Management If you spend a lot of time sifting through reviews about First Data, you\u2019re bound to find some negative sentiments, particularly in the older reviews and among those who\u2019ve left the company. Take that for what it\u2019s worth. Keep your eyes on the prize. The best thing that management can do \u2013 both for its clients and its employees \u2013 is to continue to innovate, develop talent, grow the topline, and manage expenses. It\u2019s all hard work to get right, but the payoff for everyone at the company is when clients have access to the breadth of our new solutions and the share price moves higher. Back in 2013, few would have believed that a company with an illiquid stock valued at around $11 a share would be publicly traded in the range of $18. That\u2019s good, but no one should be satisfied. First Data has a lot of headroom to grow, and it\u2019s better to focus on what\u2019s needed to do that than reading old Glassdoor reviews from folks who aren\u2019t bought in to the journey ahead.", "rating": 5, "pros": "I\u2019ve been at First Data since 2014 and read Glassdoor reviews from time to time.

An old school 'get rid of the bottom 10% each year' philosophy is in play. It's not manage up or manage out -- it's just manage out. The severance policy has also been severely cut over the years, but they still want you to leave on your own to avoid that expense. There are a lot of community programs that are in place, more for the optics (LGBT, Veterans, Millennials, etc), but anyone and everyone is just a warm body - no real desire or effort to keep employees who fit in these groups. If you are in one of these groups, expect to be exploited to the fullest capacity to the company's benefit, not yours. Had a LGBT friend who kept to himself but was essentially forced to be open in the company as gay, internally on the employee website. He has since left. No one would dare to go against Executive Management's will, for fear of their job. If you are a legacy First Data person, hired 3+ years ago, you are considered to be what the 'problem' with the company is. You are considered to be three levels below that of the intelligence that a NYC employee can bring. From what I observed, they may be somewhat intelligent in a narrow subject, but lack the broad experience and vision that many of the legacy leadership had. Unfortunately, they pushed out a lot of the top talent, specifically the 'get things done' talent at all levels that the clients adored compared to the competitors, and now the MO is to BS their way through why things aren't getting improved from the prior year. Lots of busy work, little in the way of true improvements from prior years. Slowly chugging away, but always getting further behind due to their 'budgets remain flat or cut' mantra. 'Leadership' is lacking, as its more just highly paid management rolling down duties of what 'leaders' should do. There is no desire by many of the executive management to be accountable or look inwardly. If some of them read the book \"Extreme Ownership\", they would disagree with the authors. If you are interested in a role there, and not in the Jersey City or NY office, ask when the last time the top executive leader paid a visit to that location. It will be similar for the SVP level as well. It is important to note that companies can pay for special access to Glassdoor, and influence what is being put here. First Data is one that pays for that access. You'll see spurts of great reviews, sometimes under their real titles, and sometimes not -- all to adjust the 'positivity' that this company truly lacks with this Executive Management group that ousted the last. Not all Executive leadership is bad, some have great hearts, some don't care. What is hilarious is when there was a large focus on what was being posted on Glass Door, as well as internal surveys, when folks criticized 'Senior Management', it was interpreted by the Executive leadership (SVPs and EVPs) as the VP level that was the problem, not them themselves. I assure you that it was not the VP or Director level that was being criticized. With this latest Executive Leadership team, it's been, or coming on, 3 years of limited growth. Many SVPs make more than the previous EVPs before their reign, but yet their programs are much smaller than what the previous regime had. They are finally going back to what First Data did for growth -- acquisitions. So much for being better than the previous regimes who relied on this same growth strategy. This is a great company, despite the tactics used to squeeze as much money out for the Executive Leadership as they can. It shouldn't be a surprise, as it happens at a lot of NYC based firms -- just disappointing a great midwest founded company with great midwest folks got sucked up and bled dry by the NY banking industry. It will be great again, when they realize the costs to have a Jersey City and NYC base of operations is cost prohibitive, and this regime moves on to the next company to get rich from. Advice to Management I personally know that advice to Management is disregarded, especially from what they would say is by a supposed disgruntled ex-employee. For the sake of all my friends and family still there, please 'demonstrate' that you actually care about them. At one time, the employee was seen as the #1 asset. Bring that back, and you'll see more commitment and productivity from the 'legacy' folks you quickly dismiss.", "rating": 3, "pros": "People with knowledge of the business 'within the ranks', who care about what they do and the success of the business. Pay is above average at some levels, particularly in the VP and above roles. Hard to lose money in this business, as First Data is in the middle of a lot of commerce! A few very intelligent, but introverted EVPs -- the President is very intelligent, but they don't openly rally the employees themselves. Going back to an acquisition growth strategy has worked in the past, it's about time they've gone back to what works, even if it's not an innovative strategy.", "cons": "While pay is good to great in some roles, the benefits are below average.
