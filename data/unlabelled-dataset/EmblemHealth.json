In all fairness, the patient advocate program was newly rolled out and therefore many of the specifics could not have been appreciated until further examination after the program was executed. 2. Employers were dishonest about the position merely being a pilot position during hiring and even after orientation. The respectable thing to do would have been to state this straight out. 3. Due to the fact that most new hires had little to no healthcare experience, there really should have been a supervisor present on a day to day basis for the first month to help acclimate new hires to facilities and to demonstrate which duties to focus on and how to best go about doing so. 4. Adequate tools were not given to allow employees to fulfill their daily duties without any major inconveniences- for example, the position required checking wait times for patients but employees were not given reliable internet connectivity to access EPIC. Another duty was to market patient portal- but we were never given any tutorials or access on how to navigate the patient portal we were trying to advertise. Also were not given a person in the dept for the patient portal to notify of glitches, misinformation posted, general help, etc. etc. 4. Also wish there was better administration in the medical facility its self, as there was a perpetual struggle to get any guidance or support in advocate goals or objectives.
