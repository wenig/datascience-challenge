Then I was offered a Team Leader position within the store however for Currys not carphone. I took the opportunity for progressional purposes within Carphone. I was a Team Leader for 10 months as I wasn't enough of a \"yes\" man for Dixons. I then demoted my position and transferred back to carphone within the same shop. This is where I went wrong. Don't get me wrong, however there are some incredibly well performing store in stores however this store has never performed due to poor management since it first opened. There is no support from either carphone/Currys management so when the store is consistently not performing each and every carphone colleague will get a poor review and threatened that your job is it risk. I feel incredibly sorry for new staff members joining the business within store in stores which are low performing stores as there is literally no hope for them. When you ask wether you can transfer to the stand alone carphone stores they say that it's physically not possible and your transfer will be blocked.

It is not possible to plan ahead, and communication of these new changed priorities is thin on the ground. \"Flexible working\" and hot-desking operate in the Acton office - you don't have to be in the office all the time and there are no set desks.

Being managed on a system that is flawed and doesn't have all the deals that are available to us on the old systems. PIE, the till system. Looks like teletext, behaves like teletext, we work in a technology industry so why are we still using a system from the early 80's Targets inflated and footfall not taken into account, seems like someone sits in an office and plucks a number out of the air. Geek squad. Legally we cannot be managed on this yet the company expects us to sell overpriced insurance to 50% of out contract customers and we still get managed on this as a KPI, enter the dodgy sales people...explained below. RGM'S having different focuses to store BM'S, this is clearly noticeable when the priority changes in an instant and we are threatened with performance management for something we didn't know was being so heavily pushed. Daily conference calls to discuss the figures sent out in an email, these calls are held during store opening times removing the manager from the sales floor. Constant bombardment of text messages and whatsapp messages from management during the day. Also being ridiculed and bullied for a poor day or asking about an issue you didn't know how to fix. Mystery shop criteria constantly being changed and stores not briefed about changes until the month after so impossible to hit. Part if the mystery shop is our magic moments which are a set of quotes that need to be said to pass the mystery shop however they are not natural and all members of staff feel uncomfortable saying and also extras need to be offered as part if the mystery shop even though the \"customer\" has not decided on a device. No progression opportunities as we have \"designate\" managers who are floating managers and these will fill any BM vacancies immediately rather than progressing the hard working employees in the store. Whistle blowing process not worth the time of day. Personally have submitted several whistle blowing forms about managers who actively push their teams to sell insurance and accessories to customer using discounts and chashback without advising the customer and telling them the insurance is free, legally insurance cannot be free, this is regulated by the FCA however nothing ever comes about from it no matter how many times it is highlighted to senior management. Our online sister company's eg e2save send all their issues into store so we get hit with returns so have to work doubly hard to achieve our exaggerated targets. These returns do get removed but not for 3 months so we get penalised for the return by management during our monthly reviews. Overall the people who do the job correctly are being managed out of the business yet the people pushing dodgy sales are the ones being praised and rewarded.
