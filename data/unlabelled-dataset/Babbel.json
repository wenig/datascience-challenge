No Personal space is possible in an environment like this. They can get away with all of this unwanted behavior because of their title 'Head of XX'. Also be ready for unethical behavior. Talking bad about everyone behind his/her back, is common. Worst part is, people who are responsible for coordination between different teams know that kind of language is being used and are still 'OK' with it. They will take advantage of you, if you are not familiar with salary expectations in Berlin. Not good for career as they use open source software and think it's the end of the world.
