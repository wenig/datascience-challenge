Sales Engineers do not get to go to Sales Kickoff! - Need I say more. You have to walk on water to make your Bonus - consider yourself extremely lucky if you get to make 50% of your Bonus. \u00a0I recently saw a slide deck posted on slideshare - \"Top 10 Reasons to work at Information Builders\". After years of mistreating employees, it seems desperation is setting in as they were 11 sheets of pure fiction. \u00a0People have not gotten raises for years. Current employees can walk out the door and get at a MINIMUM 20 % salary increase. The company has no clue how to take care of their dedicated, underpaid employees and some are walking out the door. If you do get a call from a headhunter regarding their openings - it only means that the headhunter is desperate. Most good headhunters refuse to work with them. I talked to a few and heard nothing but complaints of being underpaid. If you still want to talk to them , ask them to supply you a copy of the comp (bonus/commission) plan before you put any effort into the interview process. - You will thank me later.

If not, no bonus. After 34 years in business, nobody in the marketplace knows who Information Builders is from a brand perspective.
