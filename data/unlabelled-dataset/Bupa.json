Employees who do the work and may not be interested in promotion but happy where they are, are considered strange and abohorrent for not wanting to advance somehow. There is only respect for ambition, very little respect for those who do the hard, sometimes very tedious work day in and day out while they are forced to also spend time accounting for every single minute of their day in a tracker.
