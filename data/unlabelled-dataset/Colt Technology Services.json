Colt predominantly focuses on the UK and EU customers and more recently Asia -------------------------------------------------------------- I worked in the UK, London Office Carl Grivner, CEO. He knows what he is doing, comes across as humble and has sensible plans. they are certainly working hard to have a diverse set of people to work for the company unfortunately they are losing the skills and experience of employees replacing new for old (recruiting interns/ grads and slowly and quietly making employees who have been around for 7+ years redundant) which is clever if you think about it paying a lot less and saving money for the business. He Also emphasizes that Colt has a role to play in society with the work they do around CSR which was actually something that was started by the previous CEO Rakesh Bhasin Learn on the job. You don\u2019t need to be up to your eye balls in fancy qualifications to do most of the jobs. teams are so varied you have to just have a good attitude and work hard to get it. Diversity. People don\u2019t care about your background, ethnicity or anything like that \u2013 it\u2019s what you bring to the table Work Hours are flexible and you can work from home depending on your role The People. On the whole they are a nice bunch of people to work with. They are always busy but are approachable and you will often find one person having multiple roles Work Environment. It\u2019s quite good to be fair, they have invested heavily in a new office (in London) and more up to date equipment (Laptops) Cons Okay, so now you know about Colt it\u2019s become apparent that it is very hard to climb the corporate ladder. Each company has its own large hierarchy with hundreds of people working for it; due to the numbers involved it is often the case of not what you do but rather \u201cwho\u201d you know which will allow you to progress. You can get someone incredibly talented at but will never get chance to move up and really shine due to the odds against them \u2013 this means that good people leave as they aren\u2019t progressing as quickly as could have been. Based on what I\u2019ve seen people usually leave the firm after 1-2 years (sometimes just after 1 year) at lower levels as it dawns on them that you are playing a numbers game. Politics. Okay, I\u2019ve yet to work for any company where people don\u2019t play politics; it\u2019s a fact of life. Unfortunately I feel that those that have made it to pretty good positions (VP, Director level) are reluctant to do good job and end up falling into the politics game. I hear very senior people saying \u201cwork together as one company\u201d but in reality in each team managers are playing politics and looking after their own interests. No one from very high up ever visits the \u2018ground troops\u2019 and so they are out of touch of what it\u2019s like back on the floor (I assume they are always in important meetings being told everything is fine). Pay and bonuses. I said this a few years ago and it\u2019s still the same \u2013 unless you are one of the lucky few forget about being handed a cheque with a long number on it. Those days are well and truly over\u2026.infact they never existed in Colt Sure, some lucky senior people will get a big reward but most of us are just well paid grunts. Speaking of which the pay is not amazing, however when you work it out per hour it\u2019s honestly not above and beyond any other place. My contract states my working hours are 9-5. Every day I work 08:30 \u2013 18:30, which is alright (it used to be a lot worse 3 years ago!). I don\u2019t get rewarded for all those extra hours though so it makes my bonus almost insulting each year. Every year people go into \u201cthe room\u201d expecting to be told you\u2019ve just got a big fat pay check and every year you get told \u201chere is your 0.5% pay rise and \u00a3100 bonus\u201d. G Annual reviews. Seriously \u2013 there isn\u2019t any point if I\u2019m honest. There isn\u2019t a structured career path for most to take. It\u2019s like most jobs \u2013 take your seat, work hard based on your role, think outside the box by making stuff better and learn some things along the way. There isn\u2019t anything I\u2019m aware of where they have a structured career path, despite HR making out there is such a thing. My manager is woeful at best; it\u2019s like taking career advice from a fast food manager with politics thrown into the mix. Leadership. Same as everywhere else I\u2019ve been. Lots of managers but not natural leaders. A lot of managers are not real leaders, despite what they view themselves as; happy to delegate and be the chief getting paid the most but somehow avoid listening to concerns, helping nurture talent, provide knowledge to those below, working with other teams. Usually a case of \u201cI\u2019m in charge do what I say\u201d rather than \u201cI have something to teach\u201d. Pigeon Holed. People feel like they are stuck in certain roles and are not given the chance to move. A complete \u201cus and them\u201d attitude \u2013 both don\u2019t know what is really involved by either side. You made it! Now you can read about that dreaded one star rating that makes you question if the whole company is rotten to the core (it\u2019s not; it\u2019s down to who you end up working with, promise). :)Show Less Advice to Management Advice to Management Take the time to go back to the grass roots - there are lots of rough diamonds that are being hidden by a political layer of middle managers.

Cons IT and related technology seemed to be at odds with the commercial needs of a cash conscious company in a tough low margin market. A lot of deadwood in the UK characterized by basic errors promoted by 'internal experts' as best practice. It is unclear why Colt as an organisation would be attractive to a major player e.g. no incentive for a major player to buy up capability they already have access to. Current, CxO level management lack the competencies, courage and conviction required to meet the challenge ..... in fairness can an organisation of the size and pedigree of Colt feasibly attract the caliber of an innovative inspiring leader who can steer the company to a hugely profitable and innovative organisation. So perhaps Colt's best strategy is muddle through with the crumbs from the table, making modest profit along the way for the mid to long term ? An apt analogy is \"Colt is a small fish living in a large pond over populated with predators ..... whether extinct, on the endangered list or evolving further up the food chain ?\" I leave you to do your own research and reach your own conclusions.
