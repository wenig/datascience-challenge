I worked at Arcadia for 6 months part time and I can confirm that it is the most hideous, demeaning, disgusting, unacceptable, atrocious and despicable place to work at. Firstly, the management are rude and unhelpful when you are in need of any assistance. Certain individuals seem to go out of their way to make your life a misery whilst you are there. When you are in need of any help, you are told to call the \"support line\"- and you are connected to a manger who is SUPPOSED to advise you on what to do next. However, most of the time you are asked to check your procedure manuals, which requires you to waste even more time and half the time your queries are not even covered in the manuals you are given. Additionally, the training is below mediocre. This is because it provides insufficient guidance to carry out your job, and once you leave training, you are thrown into the job without any further assistance. Ultimately, the training is of a very low standard. On top of this, you are advised to wear \"smart clothing\", and are told off if you do not adhere to this. BUT, when it is A MEMBER OF MANAGEMENT wearing CROP TOPS AND SANDALS, no one says anything to them. You are expected to be at work bang on time, which is absolutely fine, but when the mangy computers are not working, and you sign in 1 minute late because of it, a manager had the nerve to ask me why i signed in 1 minute late. 1 minute. A single minute. His exact words were- \"Was there anything significant about this day, why did you sign in late?\" After I explained about the dodgy computers, he went ahead and wrote me a LETTER OF CONCERN regarding my lateness. Concerned about what? Your bacterial infested computers? Talking of computers, the office allegedly underwent a \"deep clean\" where they apparently cleaned and disinfected the computers. This involved a team of cleaners coming in and scrubbing the computers/keyboards/mouses etc. After instructing everyone to move to the cleaned computers, I sat down at a computer which had allegedly been cleaned. I sat down, loaded up my system, and decided to inspect to what extent the equipment had been cleaned. All I did was rotated my mouse upside down. On the bottom of my mouse was a murky black substance. I felt sick. I was disgusted. Shocked. I felt absolutely violated. IF you are going to clean something, pls do it properly. The company is not flexible in terms of time off, if you require a day off, they usually say tough because 99.99999999% of the time you arent going to get it. When booking days off, you will have to select random days because you have to take what you can get. If it is an emergency, they will make you do a shift swap, so you will have to make up the hours by working somebody else's shift. The customers are rude and make you feel like rubbish. Depression hits you when you walk into the building. You will be counting the minutes until you can leave. In fact, you will be praying to be sent to prison because it seems like a lighter sentence than Arcadia. They ask you to hit targets which are impossible, and if you do not hit these they keep calling you into meetings which results ultimately in dismissal if you cannot carry these out. Employee turnover rate is a joke, nobody stays here for long, for a good reason. You are shouted at for TAlkiNg to Your colleAgues, but when the managers are having mothers meetings, no one says anything. Its quite rude tbh. Discount is rubbish. The Point of sale card you are given has too many catches e,.g. you have to pay on a card with your name on it, only 10% on shoes because they are made by a separate company- I'd rather clean toilets than work here anymore to be honest.
