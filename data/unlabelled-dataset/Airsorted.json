The things you will learn in this position, if you have the chance to work there during the growing phase in particular, are invaluable. If you like to have freedom of expression and like to be able to share your ideas for making something better - this is a great place. You will be faced with many challenges, but these will all contribute to your growth in the long-term. Your multi-tasking skills will become second-to-none doing this position, and you will have a team of very friendly people around to support you. The team in London in particular (the biggest team) are very lively and welcoming - they all get along very well and very much enjoy each others company which is a great attribute for a company. Cons The work-life balance is not the greatest but this is not necessarily a bad thing seeing as some people enjoy this type of culture, particularly to gain experience. You will however be faced with many challenges, and though I mentioned this in the \"pros\" section, it can be equally frustrating at times. You'll need to develop very strong conflict resolution skills and communication skills to overcome issues that will eventually or regularly upset customers. You cannot be a sensitive person or take your job too personally in this position (though its hard because you work with a lot of lovely customers)! Advice to Management Keep doing your thing! My manager at the time when I worked with Airsorted was amazing and I adored her. The top guys in London are also ridiculously friendly and smart. They know how to get things done and be stern, but they are also lovely to deal with and have a good sense of humour.

I am speaking more so as a person who did not work in the head office in London. Sometimes you feel like your hard work isn't necessarily being recognized or appreciated because you do not work directly with them and therefore they cannot see your work attitude on a daily basis.
