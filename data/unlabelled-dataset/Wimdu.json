Sobald das Geldverbrennen von Rocket Internet nachl\u00e4sst, wird die Firma zusammenklappen. Terrible management, or better the lack of management. The company lacks clears goals or structures. The company is built up on interns, while several key positions are filled by inexperienced employes. While the general atmosphere amongst the teams could be describe as good, the general company atmosphere sways between frustration and disappointment. While there isnt generally anything wrong with hiring interns, the company hires them as a cheap labor alternative with no real intention of keeping them on board for the long term, which results in a constant state of disorganization and loss of knowledge. Most interns who get hired, aren't aware that this isn't what an Internship should be like - and while the work isn't hard, everything that one learns can be summed up in 2 hours. Work consists of the same menial tasks over and over again. The biggest issue might be the fact that the management - especially Arne Bleckwenn and Hinrich Dreiling have no clue how to \"people manage\" and run a company. Their lack of direct and intelligent leadership only enhances the feeling that Wimdu is a copy cat clone of AirBnb looking for a quick exit (which they have clearly missed).
