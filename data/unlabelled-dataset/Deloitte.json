They set high standards, and consistently deliver. Their project expectations and planning is excellent. The top level management folks are extremely smart and have a great sense of vision and planning. If you go to company social events (which are very frequent by the way), it is quite easy to have conversations with upper management people (Partners). Deloitte's hiring pattern is very consistent. For the young starters, they hire smart, well spoken, and subtly aggressive candidates. They have excellent training and knowledge management. They have a well oiled and empowered HR and Tech Support group. Things get done pretty fast. Their paid time off program is really great, and pretty straight forward. No messing about. They have a big social responsibility program that encourages volunteering. It also presents a great opportunity for youngsters to take event organizing responsibilities. This can be very very useful. Once, I volunteered for an event where we painted rooms for an orphanage center. There was a young guy who did the organizing. We were 10-12 people, with 3 senior executives actually doing paintwork. Quite unique. I have personally seen that Deloitte's top talents tend to start young, spend a 3-4 years, then take a hiatus to pursue a Graduate Degree (typically an MBA). The firm sometimes re-hires these consultants after their MBA with generous financial incentives. They offer much better packages to folks graduating from top universities. Sometimes they can offer huge joining bonuses. I worked in the IT consulting division.They tend to get top-end projects. On projects, the average age seems pretty low. A lot of 20-somethings, then there are a handful of 30-40 year old people and some senior Management folks. Beginner salaries can be a bit low. (which is expected. It takes some time to build credibility in the Consulting business) Overall, a great place to start your professional career. If you pay attention, you will get seasoned very quickly. Cons Work-life balance can become poor, especially during tight project timelines (This is expected in the Consulting Business). The employees have a significant amount of \"firm-internal\" training and knowledge contribution tasks. There are annual goal expectations. It can get tedious if you continuously work on high demand projects. There is intense competition, especially during targeted promotion/milestone years. There can be some backstabbing. It's part of the experience. It is not as bad as it sounds, and seems manageable. A lot of times, being young and inexperienced has it's flaws. The company has a simple way of seasoning consultants. They get pushed into high pressure situations, and they learn fast, and quickly start managing their own work. But they tend to be blind towards intricate details, especially in complicated IT product implementations. This has an interesting effect. If someone is able to do the hands-on work, everyone else tries to piggy-back on that person for their actual work. The hands-on guy gets overwhelmed, and others try to use him/her as a key resource. -- I personally went through a crunch project, and found a number of people \"managing expectations\" (piggy backing), while a handful of people actually knew the end-to-end solution and did the hands-on work. This created a lot more work and mental anguish than needed. Because of the expressed pressure, the hands-on guys have a hard time building and growing their reputation and subsequent performance evaluation rating. This also affects the project execution timelines. IMPORTANT: Make sure you thoroughly read through your employment agreement and understand the implications. In recent years, they have started hiring for specific projects ONLY. This falls under a particular \"AMS service line\". In this case, if your assigned project gets into a problem, you are exposed to the risk of employment termination. Their HR and Management are very helpful, and they will try to get you a new project. But there are several constraints like location, your skills, and limited time. I went through this, and it was somewhat unnerving. This was one of the reasons I ended up leaving the company. Advice to Management I have high regards for the Senior Management in this company. I think they are the market leaders in the industry, especially with their consistent high standards. Personally, I think they should strongly encourage some \"end-to-end\" hands-on responsibility in the IT consulting division. There are very few hands-on guys. I have seen a lot of segregation of duties between people that causes endless heartburn during crunch project timelines.", "rating": 5, "pros": "These folks know exactly what they are doing.

In Services, this is not the case, in fact the MD says continually that you will not become a Sr. Manager, or above - might as well look elsewhere in Deloitte. Benefits are great, although we have increasing (as expected) cost each year for health benefits, and less is covered by health care each year.

Basically, in order to take a care free vacation you have to work twice as hard to offset those non-productive PTO hours so your utilization rate will remain high. My last year there I was at ~125% utilization, had stellar feedback from my director and senior manager, and still only received an \"average\" rating. I saw many good, hard-working people get put on a performance improvement plan because their utilization rate wasn't at a suicidal level... I think the only reason Deloitte wins Working Mother Best Place to Work and other similar awards that imply the firm has a solid work-life balance approach is due to the option to go part-time. Part-timers have a supreme amount of flexibility so sure, if they are taking those people into account then yeah, the work-life balance is amazing. However, for those of us that were full-time, you're nothing more than a hour billing machine to be oiled and milked for every last penny. I had some nights that I worked so hard and long that it didn't make sense to go to bed to only get an hour of sleep before I had to hop in the shower and get ready for my next day. The culture is very clique driven. If you work outside of the mothership (DC area) you are at a severe disadvantage because you can't participate in the popularity contest that drives finding project work. People would brag about working on Christmas, Thanksgiving, and other holidays because that's what is expected of you if you want to advance. I stayed for a few years to get some resume beef and some excellent experience, then I had to move on otherwise the job was going to literally kill me.
