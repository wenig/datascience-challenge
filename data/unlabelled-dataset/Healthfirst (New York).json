Well, your pay when you start in 2017 would typically start at about $17.33 an hour, which adds up to about $36,050 a year. There is a 3% yearly increase every year as long as you do what you are supposed to do. Everyone gets this increase. You can get more if you take special projects and ect. You can work this position for as long as you want and they will increase in pay every year. There are people that are working this position for more than 15 years and they are the nicest people you will ever meet! For every $1 you contribute to your 401k (up to 6% of your pay), Healthfirst, will make a company matching contribution of $1 to your account which is administered by Vanguard. PTO (Paid time off) is offered in days, so you start initially with 152 hours which is 19 days. The offer paid holiday leave for the following days, New Year\u2019s , Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. They close at 3pm the business day before the paid holiday mentioned. You get paid for the hours your shift runs past the 3pm mark. Cons Working here at Healthfirst is currently a test of civil and social dexterity. I will break down to you some points about this Member Service position. The Dress code is business casual and they have dress down Fridays on occasions. There is a monthly one on one review with your supervisor where you can get an update on how you are doing on the phone. Typically you would know all of your attendance metrics since this in the Verint system they use to track all your calls. The first month you get no official scored, just FYI\u2019s. After that, the calls are graded and will affect your payout and overall call metrics. Managers of customer service seem to be, well, obtuse to the customer service experience. Ironically, most of them were Member services representatives. You will meet the during training and see them walk around. You will see what I mean. You earn a quarterly bonus for keeping your attendance, which includes not missing days and being at your desk. You have to keep it above 98% to receive the quarterly incentive max payout of $450. Then it breaks down to $350 (97 \u2013 97.99%), $250 (96% \u2013 96.99%) and $150 (95-95.99%). Anything below 95, there is no monetary reward. You also earn a quarterly bonus for the QA (Quality Assurance) calls. Now the max for this bonus is $725 if your QA call averages above 99% and above. Then it breaks down to $650 (98-98.9 %), $500 (97-97.9%). Anything below 97 % does not merit a reward. One major thing to note is that your calls will be reviewed by the Florida Healthfirst call center. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the sun down there but there are always errors in these monthly calls which can dramatically crash your score. So you guess it, it will affect your payout. You have the right to rebut your calls and have the scores reviewed. You are given a chance to listen to the calls, so you can correct the Florida rep errors and have your score back up where it belongs, thus allowing your pay to be the max. The rebuttal process is not web based, it via email using a word document template. Go figure. Advice to Management hire Outside management who can see things from fresh eyes.

You have executives who know less than their direct reports, and who lie to their managers about what they know. One executive spends most of his time on Skype talking to friends and relatives. Another who watches YouTube videos all day long. Another who puts together PowerPoints that no one asks for, on topics that aren't important. You have egotistical maniacs at the middle and upper management level, who are allowed to give their input on processes about which they know nothing. There's so much jockeying for power. So much. And in between jockeying for power and playing these games, some of these folks forget they have an actual job to do. You have poor processes all around. You have a lack of investment in real infrastructure and technology that would help the company grow. Just look at the reviews on Yelp. The foray into the commercial market was a disaster thanks to the lack of systems to support that kind of growth. They do not value, nor understand, technology, and they're going to get clobbered in the marketplace because of it. You have favoritism galore. One person is so highly favored that she's been promoted multiple times over just a few years, all while being detested by her colleagues for her nastiness, being terrible at her actual job, and having no identifiable skills. But, she's gone out for drinks with her bosses and cozied up to people who mattered, so they protect her despite multiple complaints. You have a completely unethical review process. You're reviewed by your colleagues, your boss, and any direct reports you have. Fair, right? Well, it would be, except that everything those people say about you is then reviewed in a room with 20+ OTHER PEOPLE WHO DO NOT KNOW YOU OR YOUR JOB. Those people are allowed to weigh in on whether you need improvement, meet expectations, or exceed expectations. They then use everyone's input to place you somewhere on a *BELL CURVE* (yes, the measurement of human capability that has since been thoroughly debunked). Oh! Also! Those 20+ people who weighed in on your job? They get to see what everyone said about you, but you, yourself, don't. You have a culture that focuses on the wrong things.There is no better example of this than the fact that they spent millions on consultants to come up with a terrible metaphor that they push on every employee: TRAILBLAZER. \"Are you being a trailblazer?\" \"Can you recite the trailblazer culture drivers?\" They spent so much money coming up with an internal campaign for employees based on a hiking/mountain metaphor. For city dwellers. Who service other city dwellers. Yet they never spent the money to fix *major* billing and enrollment issues for our customers before entering the commercial market. Also, the NYC office is battling a bed bug problem. There are *smart,* wonderful people here who will never be valued for their contributions, and who will never flourish or grow. They will leave, snatched up by better companies doing better things. Those who stay are often depressed, cynical, and hopeless. To use their own metaphor: don't blaze this trail.

The following year, those 2 are still performing high, as are 2 others. Are you going to lower the rating on the employees who previously received the high rating, and rate the new high performers high? Or are the new high performers out of luck, because the others got there first. This system demotivates high performers while retaining mediocre/poor employees, resulting in poor retention, at least for high performers.
