Just a friendly team who support each other - The culture is hard to beat. From nerf guns and ping pong tournaments to its open-door policy in terms of suggestions for new benefits to offer staff - The job opportunity is rare. The company has big ambitions to disrupt the banking industry - not really surprising they're getting a lot of attention and big-name investors - Very strong 'learning' emphasis - everyone challenges each other to learn more and share ideas. And there is budget to back it up, if you want to go on courses etc - Decent set of benefits, especially for a startup Cons This is not a job for the faint-hearted. The company is moving fast, building something people haven't seen before, and disrupting an entire sector - that's exciting, but not easy. That means standards are high and the quality of team members is high - you're expected to fail often, learn fast, and seek constant development. That's not something that comes naturally to everyone - so you need to think about whether that sounds like you, before taking the plunge.

Our product aims to reduce the fragmentation and converge all your money in one single place; it\u2019s super complicated and ambitious. I\u2019ve worked for other companies where the product\u2019s complexity was not even near Curve\u2019s. And therefore, I am being challenged and learning a lot every day since I joined Curve. We are still a small team, so if you do want to be a rock star and make meaningful contributions to our superb product, now it\u2019s the right time to join. Despite being a small team, we have a lot of people from different countries and cultures, which creates an incredible and unique environment to work. Everyone is friendly and there's a collaborative culture across the entire company. Conditions are excellent, from your favourite laptop to books you need, you just need to ask. Snacks, water, coffee, everything is provided, not to mention the great location (Shoreditch, at the moment). Cons Not a Cons in my opinion, but might be for others. There are probably three types of rock stars: - They are a genius, and they work hard (aka, Unicorns) - They are genius - They work incredibly hard to achieve the expected results You will get everything you need to succeed.
