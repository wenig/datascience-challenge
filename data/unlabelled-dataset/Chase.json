Health Insurance: Chase has high deductible insurance like other companies. But the catch is their saving accounts. They have two accounts for Health: MRA and HCSA. (notice: other company usually offer HSA which is totally different.). MRA is called medical reimbursement account. When you have body checked annually and some data is met, then Chase will give you $200 to this account and the fund CANNOT be used for dental and vision. HCSA is called Healthcare saving account and you contribute semi-monthly. Basically money in your account is yours. However, if you contribute more than $500 per year and don't spend them by EOY, the amount over $500 will be forfeited by Chase. YES, your money will be taken away by Chase. Looks like they are making money and it is their benefit not yours. When you left the company, fund in MRA will be forfeited by the end of that month and fund in your HCSA will be forfeited by following March. 401K: You don't have 401k match first year period. You will have 401k match second year and the match will come to your account at the end of 2nd year: If you leave between 1-2 years, you cannot even see the money. You can keep 401k match at the end of 3rd year. But notice they always give you the match at the end of year, so you cannot make money from the match through the years. Annual increase and Incentive: 3-5% sometime less Culture & Value: Each line of business just pushes their responsibilities out and so many politics go on. If other people's pay grade is higher than you, you need to follow their orders even if they know nothing literally. Some of them just have more years of work experiences than you and they don't even know how to use the tools required for their daily work, but you still have to cover them.

They will train you, pay for licensing, hone you to their standards and make you comfortable, as long as you don\u2019t think. The benefits, though constantly constricting, are ok. Cons For a company that place is such an emphasis on finding value to add (in soliciting customers), they fall short in adding value to their existing resources and people. It is truly sad when employee in a booming economy has to fight for pay raises and commission payouts, When a corporation is showing extraordinary profitability. It is also truly sad when employees hit plateaus or glass ceilings because it would cost That same employee to move up the ladder. It would cost them in time it would cost them and lost sales pipeline and ultimately in income from 1 to 3 years. It\u2019s also unfortunate that there is a Glass ceiling when it comes to age and upward mobility in this company. Find me a NEW relationship manager who is over the age of 40. Finally, it\u2019s unfortunate that this company has pigeonholed itself in the offering of products and services. While they sell the shiny appearance of \u201cprivate client\u201d, and offer these positions to potential employers as \u201ca privilege\u201d - It is no longer a truly privileged position. And there is no true value (for branches outside of major metro areas). Rates are same, lines are same and the banker that was supposed to be their dedicated point man can\u2019t help, because he\u2019s reversing the fees on an account for someone who shouldn\u2019t be banking in the first place. The only thing that made Private Client special is that employee - he/she is the difference between standard retail brand banking and private client banking. Not the product, not the name - it\u2019s the employee. Employment with this company Has turned out to be a diminishing return on my investment of time, money and expertise. It\u2019s a shame, I once loved this place! Advice to Management There seems to be a general disconnect (between all levels of management) in the management of resources; including people, time, money, technology, and in real property. Make sure the computers work. A ten year old desktop running internet explorer on windows xp is not a \u201cprivate client\u201d experience Make sure your furniture doesn\u2019t look like a goodwill acquisition. Chairs that have big chunks missing from arms, seats that creak and crack when clients sit in them and cubicles that provide no privacy are downright embarrassing when you call yourself Private Client Reduce the number of branches to avoid saturation (1 branch for every 2 square Miles in Vegas is overkill and leads to difficult sales in-fighting, overzealous and used car sales tactics and a reduced potential pool of qualified prospects). A pool of 5000 prospects (50% of population covered by typical branch) may actually yield 1000 qualified prospects of which 500 already Bank/invest with us. Do the math - squeezing a stone will not make it yield gold, it will only crush it to dust, Clearly define job title rolls, and stick to those rolls - private client bankers should not be doing notaries for core clients, opening second chance checking or prepaid cards for prior charge offs or password resets for the 20th time this year... Private client needs to focus on the HNW clients in order to get paid! Lastly, pay your employees like you truly care - not just a shiny slogan - do what IS right and pay those people what they deserve. And DONT make them fight for it - they will only defect to your competitors (with a good portion of their book following, not because they solicited them, but because the clients sought out those bankers - the difference-makers ... the whole reason the chose to open accounts and invest in the first place.$", "rating": 1, "pros": "Great opportunity for those under 40 years old.

Bank managers, tellers, and other bank staff were all very professional and great people to work with each day. The career opportunities within the mortgage division are very good because this division is so inefficient that someone could move up quickly if they can manage to tolerate all of many issues existing the mortgage division. Cons Mortgage division was a mess to put it lightly. The loan underwriting dept was much better at denying loans than approving loans. If there was a single weakness in the loan file, the loan was denied. So, it was very, very difficult to get a loan approved. If the loan was approved, then it would have to go back and forth to the UW for review an average of 13 separate UW reviews before reaching final approval. As you can imagine, this created a very lengthy loan process for loan applicant clients. For example, a loan file typically spent 60+ days in loan processing before getting the clear to close from underwriting because of the number of reviews made by loan underwriters, the addition of new loan conditions by underwriters, lack of a sense of urgency found to exist pervasively throughout the loan fulfillment operations Centers (regional operatations Centers or centralized processing and underwriting Centers) back and forth of a loan file. The loan software systems used by the bank were all proprietary, thus no one could have prior knowledge and experience with the software unless you had already worked with the bank before in some other role before migrating into the mortgage division. Many of these proprietary software systems had significant flaws, were unreliable, and created many problems with both loan origination and processing that do not exist within the mortgage industry, but instead were a result of being associated with the bank and the attempt to integrate banking software with mortgage industry software. To sum it up, the software was a mess and the software alone created many significant issues for the bank\u2019s mortgage division. Advice to Management While the interaction of banking employees within the bank setting environment is very good, the integration of the bank software with the mortgage software is not good. The number of prospective clients for the bank seems nearly limitless at times, but the inefficiency of the mortgage division, especially in regards to the loan fulfillment Ops Centers and loan origination software make it extremely difficult to complete a loan. Because of these huge barriers existing for the mortgage origination folks, it is impossible to provide an efficient loan experience for bank clients, as well as obtaining new clients outside of the bank\u2019s internal clientele. The problems existing in just those areas (loan fulfillment underwriting and processing, and loan software and its integration with the bank\u2019s many internal software programs) alone create a huge mess that continually prevents loan origination staff from being able to provide bank clients with a good loan experience due to the lack of efficient loan fulfillment operations and computer-glitch filled loan software used by the bank for the mortgage division. These are both unbelievably inefficent. In fact, so much so to the point that the bank should strongly consider a complete overhaul of the mortgage division, thereby requiring a new software system and loan fulfillment operations plan for its loan origination and fulfillment software, loan processing and underwriting SOP\u2019s, and nearly everything as it relates to loan fulfillment operations. It was incredibly disappointing to realize how much potential was being wasted by the bank in its mortgage business channel because the potential existing for the bank within the mortgage industry seems nearly inexhaustible. However, the inefficiency existing within its loan Ops appears equally challenging, too. If the bank could solve its loan fulfillment issues, which are daunting and significant, then without a doubt the bank could dominate the mortgage industry. However, I do not believe that the bank will make the mortgage division a priority and I think they already recognize the enormity of the problems plaguing their mortgage division and are unwillingly to commit to the effort needed to correct the loan fulfillment of its loan operations.", "rating": 3, "pros": "Internal Referral System for various bank sales professionals to receive bank client prospects from both banking staff and other bank sales executives.
