Managers are acting like they did already enough, so they are not helping, but the company instead of paying them more, is giving them bigger percent of your tips, it may happen, you will work with 3 of them on the shift and guess what, you will be the only one who's running. The budgets for restaurants are so high, that even if it's crazy busy all day long, it will never be enough. This place works almost like factory, factory to make money, money. Always a mess with rotas, holidays. Never finishing on time, they do even sth like 'dots' which means you never know what time you will finish, maybe 8pm, maybe 11pm. Policy about customers is depressing, but I believe that is what buys customers these time. They don't train you even if you are good, they are just lying to you, to keep you there, best, working for free, doing e-learning at home, preparing extras at home also, just to hear that they don't have time for you. It's not that managers are the problem here, this company don't care about them too. They are also hiring anyone, without thinking if it is going to be possible to work with them later on. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone.

If you don't have all of this learnt in your first two-three weeks managers and team leaders get very very annoyed. -There is sometimes not enough hours to go around because management want to cut down on the cost of staff so much, I was forced to take a paid holiday day when they canceled on of my shifts, and it happened to everyone until they managed to get rid of some staff permanently. Advice to Management Don't give your staff 20 mins for lunch and get changed twice! Hire more people so everyone feels supported, 3-5 people doing 100+ covers is horrible.

Friendly Environment (e.g. FOH team come into your pot-wash area regularly and have small talk with you - also getting to know you and gossip lol) Breaks during quiet times. (e.g. If you can't work for long period 7am-3pm, take your break at ~11am/12pm or if you leave it later then you won't be able to unless you have another kp to cover you). Preparing/Serving Desserts (e.g. This is the \"fun\" part of the job, you get a break from the hot pot-wash area and prepare desserts for customers, learning them off by heart can be hard but there is a manual to help. Unfortunately in my experience - not a lot of people decide to buy desserts :( ) High pay-rate (e.g. Starting at \u00a37.20/hr + tips) Get to go to the cool/calm stock area (e.g Another break from the hot pot-wash area, keep stocked up on ice-cream and desserts/sauces) Weekends are really relaxed especially Sunday (e.g. all your deadlines for jobs are shifted by 30mins/1hr so you have more time to do things and take it a lot more slowly). You can choose your days off. Only do this job - If you are looking to progress up to a line-chef/looking for a long-term career (working your way up from the bottom) as soon as you get the hang of the kp role, this job is not easy and you must be ready and willing every day to get all the tasks done asap. You must not be scared of cleaning and getting your hands dirty. You must be willing to wake up early to get to work. Would NOT recommend this as your first job (don't make the mistake I did and do this as you will not enjoy it some days - they made the job sound much nicer on the application page and recruitment day) , it is HARD and it is NOT easy. You have to work quickly and efficiently and be able to multitask! You have to be a quick learner that just needs money for some things. I wouldn't recommend this as a long-term job, try to move up or out of this job because it's not a fun one - I just do my job, go home and get paid every Friday (I guess pay-day is something to look forward to). A full time role as a kp is tough. Cons Early Starts (7am starting times is pretty annoying - I have to wake up at 5am just to get there relatively on-time.) Lots of lifting heavy things (e.g. Oil cartons/Trays/Rice containers etc.) Lots of cleaning (e.g. 80% of the job is Cleaning. Plates all the time during busy times and cleaning used prep trays during the morning). Very difficult to keep up on tasks when you are on your own (e.g. Getting chicken cooked and prep'd , and then cooking rice before 9:30 so it's ready for the chefs) Can get really hot in the pot-wash area (e.g The dishwasher/glass-washer is on all the time and you need to use hot water to wash the stuff, so drink water readily.) You have to change the oil for the deep-fryer which is the worst task of the day (e.g. You need to empty the oil into empty oil cartons and clean out all the crumbs/foodstuffs that have made it to the bottom of the fryer yuck.) Stressful when its a busy day (e.g. Lots of plates and requests from chefs!) Cleaning curry pots (e.g. You get them around mid-day and they are a nightmare to clean so leave them to soak and come back later) Taking the bins from outside into the bin room (e.g. You get people looking at you funny when you do this and the bin room is like a sauna, you have to be quick with this job as it takes up your time for the other jobs.) Majority of employees don't speak fluent english, so there is a language barrier (e.g. Majority of requests they will point at what they want etc.) Only do this job - If you are looking to progress up to a line-chef/looking for a long-term career (working your way up from the bottom) as soon as you get the hang of the kp role, this job is not easy and you must be ready and willing every day to get all the tasks done asap.

Advice to Management When employing people for this role, employ in pairs because this job is hard enough as it is for one and if you want a fast, optimal service - you need at least 2 people for the job.
