Cons Senior leadership is generally smart and trust-worthy, but is kind of a boys club that you're most likely to break into by speaking loudest (literally) and getting yourself invited to happy hour whiskeys often. All-agency meetings can feel like pep rallies, and when they include news of losing business, there's a drink-the-kool-aid feel to them. This hurts morale, rather than strengthening it.
