This collaborative way of working also promotes a very social environment in which you'll make great friends and enjoy some great nights out! I've read a few reviews that highlight that some of Venn's processes are a little outdated but the company is definitely showing signs of progression. For example, in certain areas of the business the lunch break process (or lack thereof) has been re-reviewed and taking an hour is now looked upon favourably, allowing consultants to stay refreshed ahead of a productive afternoon. The hours can be long (8-6) but in any recruitment company, you will directly \"get out what you put in\" so this is not out of the ordinary. The company is also very open to flexible hours (within reason) so you never feel \"stuck at work\". Most importantly, anyone starting out at Venn will learn invaluable skills that can propel their career forward whether they decide to progress through the company or move on to pastures new.

They are firm but fair and when I say fair, I mean generous. Hard work is thoroughly rewarded with bonuses, top performers lunches, vennture points (used to buy yourself gifts and experiences) and verbal recognition from the directors is given to those that deserve it. Yes it's target driven, but it's a sales environment, what do people expect?? It's a fun place to work. Although hard work is expected you can still have a laugh and have fun with your colleagues. My team and everyone I have come across at Venn Group has made me feel very welcome and it already seems like I have been here ages as everyone has been so welcoming. The social aspect of life at Venn is great. There is always someone wanting to go for a drink after work and social events are put on regularly whether it's within your team or for the whole company. This includes many events and fundraising activities for charity. Fizzy Fridays, held at the end of the month are a winner and a great way to get to know people. I have found that Venn really do listen to their employees holding regular consultation days with members of staff to listen to their opinions and ideas. In the small amount of time I have been here many changes have taken place following a consultation day held in December. Venn value their employees opinions and they listen! I do feel some of the reviews on here are very one sided and I would hope that potential employees would take all the reviews on here into consideration and if you were still unsure, speak with the internal recruitment team and make your own mind up!
