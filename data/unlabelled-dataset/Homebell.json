There were some really nice people working at the company but is all about the only positive I could consider. Cons Where do I start..... There was over 150 people inside a 200m2, its very difficult to imagine the kind of oxygen levels in the summer heat in an office like this office, hygiene standards are unadhered too. There was very little options for water and other drinks and all were given was red bull and sweets to keep us going. If your contract states 40 hours then we should be able to do just 40 hours without the pressure of being made to stay upto 60 hours a week including weekends. Maybe if this is German culture then I dont understand how people enjoy their lives outside of the office. This was my first job in Berlin and has really shocked me to think that this is how people work in Germany. We were told that the company made alot of money in May in 1 huge meeting with all the employees in a room the size no bigger than a bedroom thats over 100 people crammed, they moved to a new office and was only 1 week after that at the end of June they fired 5 teams of us thats something like 40 people, blaming it on Brexit telling us all that we had to go for that. It makes no sense, did they invest that much money in the UK market??? What about the Spanish, the Italian and French, these have nothing to do with the Brexit and good markets, better were the Italian and Spanish market made alot of money, and I think the French and UK too. No real processes in place a kind of anything goes and if it works lets do it, this is a terrible way to run a business. They also said to alot of people they would get more pay, I dont ever remember my bonus being paid, I got it 3 times and always was something that got in the way which mean I did not get paid anything like they said and in the contract too. I can only wish them good luck with this business, they have a nice idea but it is thought in the wrong way. Not enough department and help for people who need it even with basic things like pay rolled or Human Resource. Even for selling the product there is no price and always we have to upsell upsell upsell, calling a customer back to say you need more money is not so easy when you did not know the price in the original way only to guess what is the price. Advice to Management Company grow too quickly, better that you keep it simple like now with 2 team DACH and Holland, easier too manage.
