If you are successful at what you do you will advance. Period. Armed with this mentality I went through training and hit the sales floor. The open sales floor was one that motivated me. I could see who was working and who was pretending. This gave me the ability to easily seek out advise from the people producing as they did it in front of me daily. I was told in the interview I could make some serious money while advancing. I took this with a grain of salt as all sales companies claim this. Within 18 months I was amazed at how much money I was actually earning. I actually stopped one day and calculated my hourly pay. I was making more than they said I would make so I turned my focus towards sharpening my management skills within the group. They sent me off to London for paid management training. They also sent me on an all-expenses paid week long vacation as a reward for being the top seller in the USA my first year. By year three with the group I had held the position of Sales Executive, Senior Sales Executive, Team Leader, Assistant Sales Manager, Sales Manager, and Senior sales manager. On my three year anniversary with the group I was promoted to the highest position within summit sales. Sales Director. The interesting part about all of this is that I was given the exact road map of advancement in my very 1st interview and within three years I had lived it. I did my part. I worked very hard. They did their part. They kept their word and advanced me while paying me healthy commissions and bonuses. By year 8 I was managing multiple locations in the USA and abroad.

This is a company that succeeds because it was built to give people who want to \u201cown\u201d something of their own, a place to live without worrying about all the normal overheads associated with owning your own business. The second thing that stands out is the product delivered to clients. At first I didn\u2019t understand just how hard it was for companies to get qualified business meetings. When people walked up to me and told me how one of the meetings my summit secured for them made them hundreds of thousands I was amazed. Really? We are that good? YES, Marcus Evans is. The 1 on 1 meeting space has become a dime a dozen as everybody looks at Marcus Evans and says \u201coh that looks easy we can go do it on our own\u201d. They quickly find out within a few years that it is NOT easy and they fold. To date I do not know of one Face to Face meeting company that can supply both Buyer and seller reference to deals closed. Marcus Evans is the only one who can and there are hundreds of examples to prove it. For years I watched people come on this very website and trash the company as scam. Or say that the company didn\u2019t pay well. Or say the company couldn\u2019t deliver. Some went as far to say as the company would force employees to write positive reviews. I quietly sat and watched the posts and chose not to respond. I didn\u2019t want to fuel the fire and as an active employee actually running business units I was sure my post would carry little weight. Today however there is nothing in it for me. The reason I write this message is that I enjoyed my time at Marcus Evans. I made a lot of money at Marcus Evans. I had excellent sales training at Marcus Evans. I advanced at Marcus Evans. Most will ask why I left. Simple. I could afford financially to go out into the market place with a dream of mine. Without Marcus Evans I wouldn\u2019t have the capital, experience, or freedom to do that at such a young age. Cons I do have some things that I see as areas the Marcus Evans group needs to address.

There were far too many people hired because we thought there was a \u201cchance\u201d they could make it but time at a place that requires 100% every day is no place for those looking to skate by. I also think the company could actually decrease the commission structure by 1% and use that to invest in better technology tools for the sales executives. 1% may not seem like much but I know what the top 20% make there.

Then they call your lead without your knowledge and close the deal and steal your commission. At Marcus Evans the managers are thieves. Worst CEO in the world. He sits in the back office and comes out to take attendance every day and then harass and intimidate and threaten the workers who actually showed up. Calling in sick 2 or 3 times a week is the only way to stay off the CEO's radar.

The company is clearly a scam and we lie to the clients all day long. We lie to them about the cost and about who will be attending the Summit business meetings. We lie about the success rate of the few clients we had in the past. I personally lied to every single CEO I got on the phone dropping names of executives that we never really worked with. We say we have worked with so and so in the past but it is a lie. The work day is 12 hours long and you are required to make 150 calls a day otherwise you are fired. In an office of 15 people 10 of them quit or were fired after just 3 months! The turnover rate is over 200% a year. The high turnover is the business model. Its a pyramid scheme. Every 3 weeks Marcus Evans in New York hires 4 new people and then fires 4. Every 3 weeks expect a new group to come in to replace you. As I said expect to be abused until you quit. The people who stay are the losers. At Marcus Evans its the winners that quit. Why would anyone want to work for a corrupt company?

With that being said, these comments are specific to the Summit's Delegate Acquisition Division & Department. * Incredible opportunities to travel around the country especially places like Las Vegas, Florida, and California! * All-expense paid work trips to 5 star resorts like Ritz Carlton, Waldorf Astoria, & Four Seasons. * The best sales training an inside B2B sales rep could ask for. * Exposure to C-suite executives across various Fortune 1000 industries which is a crash course in helping you figure out what industry you might want to work in next. * I had multiple opportunities to travel abroad with the company, but those are reserved for the top 10% performers or senior management. * Exceptional, consistent brand image. * The best product I've ever sold. I genuinely and deeply believe in the quality of the Summit business model and know how much it's helped my clients. It's a great product. * Rapid growth opportunity * Ability to earn your own paychecks * Some of the most wonderful colleagues in the world. In the decade I worked at Marcus Evans I met many friends I will have for a lifetime, but 4 people in particular who my life would feel incomplete without. If this company recruits that quality of people they are doing something right! Cons * The Summits CEO in Cyprus is not a nice person and will throw a colleague under the bus without blinking an eye. It's quite sad because he overshadows the many, many spectacular people in the company. * You cannot make a top-tier wage if you are only willing to work 40 hours a week. It's just not possible if you are only putting in the bare minimum effort and, unfortunately, a lot of the managers are forced to cultivate a culture of mediocrity because lazy employees are litigious.

Little do they know. If you work at the Chicago branch you'll probably develop a healthy amount of hatred for the British accent. You get to change your Linkedin job title to \"Project Executive\", knowing very well you are a mere Sales Rep. Cons Pretty much everything. Don't get it twisted. This an all day cold calling gig. Try imagining that before you accept the job offer. You are tricked into thinking you are about to join a \"world class\" company with endless opportunities for growth. And to be honest, they had me fooled. The fancy building and the shiny reception area are just a deliberate facade. As soon as you get on that sales floor you realize what a horrible mess you got yourself into. They let pretty much anyone through those doors. And I mean ANYONE. As long as you can speak in full sentences and have a pulse. At first I thought that passing the interview stage was an achievement on my part. Sadly, no! It was an achievement on the side of management as they have once again tricked another poor soul into being a temporary cog in the machine. The managers seem so nice at first - only for the first few days up until they chain you to a desk and phone. From then on its extreme micromanaging and getting humiliated and demeaned in front of the entire sales floor for making honest mistakes that come with the territory. The managers, OMG the managers! Almost all of them are on a power trip and look depressingly unhappy. They pick their favorites and shun everyone else who is not lucky enough to land a sale. I worked there for several months, and after the first week they stopped responding to a courteous \"good morning\" whenever we crossed paths. THEY ACT LIKE YOU DON'T EXIST. But if you are lucky enough to make a sale their attitude towards you changes almost instantly and they come around and give you high fives. And then its back to business as usual. They don't care about people. They only care about ringing that hypnotic bell. I've seen some managers go months without a sale. And the poor sales reps (Project Executives lol) sit there and do 120+ dials a day and someone is considered very lucky if a prospect falls for their deceptive pitch and actually books a seat. People go for long dry months without a sale. Its really sad and discouraging. The managers, on the other had, at least some of them, make sales ALL THE TIME. They have been there long enough to rig the system in their favor. They rely on the leads generated by the sales reps that come and go, and they also have the freedom to email clients whenever they want. Oh, and you are NOT ALLOWED to send out an email to a potential client without a manager's approval. They actually fire people over that. That's how intense the micromanaging goes. Almost everything you do has to be approved by someone. Most of the time you will feel like your hands are tied as you lose opportunities that could have ended up in a sale. Sometimes the managers actually YELL stuff to sales reps while they are on the phone with clients: \"say this\" \"say that\"! Very distracting and annoying. You are given a desk and a phone. No computer. You are allowed to use the assigned research computers for an hour each day. The rest of the time you are \"smiling and dialing\". The computers are very outdated. Only managers have the high privilege of having a computer at their desk. This is madness! It's a one dimensional job. Very monotonous! Same grind - day in day out. The turnover rate is through the roof. The entire time I was there I didn't meet one person that actually enjoys working there. Everyone is always talking about how they want to find something else. It's a survival job. Yes, some people stick with it and inch up the ladder. But by the time they become managers, or any of the other meaningless titles like 'senior' or 'team champ', they've been turned bitter and grumpy. And thus the cycle continues. Lunch is at 12:00 for everyone, everyday. No exceptions. \"High school, is that you?\" The base salary is insulting. If you aren't making at least 3 sales a month, which is almost completely unrealistic, you walk away with a little over $1000 per month. Managers actually go around the desks on pay day and TOSS and FLING the pathetic paper cheques in the employees' faces. #respectdoesntlivehere You are disposable, that is what the managers make very clear to you as soon as you start this job. And they never miss a beat when it comes to reminding you either. The faces around you keep changing so fast at Marcus Evans it's hard to remember who's who. You'll meet very good and funny people. But they'll be gone quicker than you can pick up the phone. The reception area is always populated by oblivious applicants waiting nervously for their interview. This is almost a daily occurrence. I've never seen anything like this! Managers are obsessed with meetings. They call a meeting almost everyday just to nag the team about stats and about how \"you aren't following the process\". I'm not sure about it but I think there are some shady things happening behind the doors at Marcus Evans. The company itself keeps getting sued for fraud. Something is rotten and it reeks. You aren't even allowed to tell people on the phone that you are with Marcus Evans. You literally have to make an effort to avoid saying \"Marcus Evans\" during the call. They lie to you during training that it is because one can never be sure about how the company is perceived by people. I think the truth is the exact opposite. The company obviously has a bad reputation and they want to close the sale before the client does some digging. That's why URGENCY is such a fundamental sales tactic for them. If you like being openly disrespected, degraded, and demeaned on a daily basis then this is the perfect job for you! And yes, of course, if luck is on your side you can make money here. But it is never consistent. You can have one or two good months and then go 4 months of just punching the clock and taking home a pathetic cheque. Advice to Management Invest in your staff! It might bring down the high turnover rate. Just maybe, though. Invest in modern technology! Be transparent with staff and clients! Be respectful of your employees. Don't let worldly corporate titles get to your head. You still have to be respectful. You expect respect so give it! It'll come back to you. Be flexible about lunch times. GET A MICROWAVE FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES!!! They have to stand in line in the building next door just to warm up their food - taking 20mins of their lunch! Come on!

And you get those sales by making 100-150 calls a day---calls that are generated by you (using LinkedIn, Google, etc....) The training is 3 days which is thought by the managers, managers who spend 3 days with you, have lunch with you....yet once training is over, they act like they don't know you. After the initial 3 days, you are supposed to fill out an \"anonymous\" survey of what you learned thus far. But at least for me, it wasn't anonymous because there was a manager in the room as we filled it out. They think they offer this great product but no one knows what Marcus Evans is. When you actually make a call you are instructed to NOT say you are calling from Marcus Evans. Which does not make sense, since one would think people would want this product----they have been around for 30+years but do absolutely no marketing to get their name out there. You won't actually see the sales floor or get your \"desk\" until the 4th day. I say \"desk\" cause it's not really yours, you move around so much and you don't actually get a computer. Computers are only for managers. You have to share a computer when you want to do research. And all these computers, even the ones managers use, are out of the Stone Age. For a company that proclaims to be so successful, one would think they would invest in some new technology for their employees. Most have to do leads and research on paper! The sales floor is a telemarking room! All fog! They will trick you with the appearance of the NBC building and it being a \"professional\" business. But you start making a salary of 18,000--that's $1000 a month! And because you won't really know the process of how to sell, realistically you won't make any good money until \"it clicks\"----that ranges from 3-6 months. That's the worst part; the base pay. If you have some money saved or are living at your parents, this might work for you. Oh, 1 more thing: it's a paper check, they do not offer direct deposit, cause they are too cheap to pay for it.

You'll get hands on experience developing and improving a variety of skill sets that are attractive to other employers. If this is your first job and you're desperate, go for it, but know that if you're college educated, hard working, and not a felon, you'll quickly outgrow this place and be suitable for much better. You'll likely make some friends at this company. But be careful because most act like high schoolers with their drama. Depending on what you do and what division you're in, you get to travel to some amazing places. But once you're there, you'll be working so hard you won't really get to enjoy it. You'll learn about a variety of different industries and meet leaders/decision makers who could potentially hire you once you're ready for a real job. Take advantage of networking with the people you meet!!!! The office GM tries really hard to make the environment fun which is cool but he could fight a little harder for real change and not just social activities and happy hours. There will be things you love about this job but they're random perks that shouldn't be reasons to love the job. And there will be moments you enjoy working there. It's very much so a roller coaster. Their Aflac rating is really good so if you purchase any Aflac plans you'll get a really fair price. Being downtown is nice. What I liked most about working there: -traveling -building relationships with some colleagues and executives I met at events -diverse role kept things interesting day to day -helped me realize what I wanted to do next in my career and prepared me for that somewhat -the office shuts down between Christmas and New Years which is nice to have that time off guaranteed -I was able to add a lot to my resume Cons You'll eventually learn it all and there's nothing more to learn after that because everything stays the same. No new ideas, no new strategies, no innovation. Actually, once you learn the organization inside and out, you'll probably know more than upper management who do not continue their own learning & development and focus almost entirely on internal affairs rather than observing what competitors are doing to improve. They don't really take feedback from their high paying clients to improve either. I found that most of what I learned during my employment at marcus evans, is how not to run a business. Don't bother suggesting ideas and strategies because there's no interest in changing any processes. There's a lot of opportunity in sales to make money if youre a combination of good and lucky. very few care about their clients, and just care about making themselves more money and reaching goals for incentives. Marcus doesn't do anything but he'll take 24% of your deal. Oh and he'll be in the office and not even acknowledge you with a polite hello or give a motivational speech to the floor. Or share his gratitude for making him one of the richest men in the UK. If he changed the culture and operations of his company, he could be a whole lot richer. They don't invest in any technology. Sales, except managers and directors, keep track of their leads on paper. Yes. Paper. The sales process is very manipulative and it doesn't have to be because the product is actually really good, but could be better. Prices for each event don't make any sense. Reps seem to make up a number sometimes which, if clients knew, is fishy and should be standard across the whole company for each event with consistent costs for up selling options. You'll spend hours and days in meetings that result in nothing accomplished. Management seems clueless most of the time. Turnover is VERRRRRRRY high and in recent years, very talented, intelligent and successful employees who have been there for years left because they couldn't take it anymore and they found better things. Chicago is a very strong market right now for great job opportunities, and this company does not compete well. The environment can be hostile. You may get harassed by the men in the office. Their finances seem like a total disaster. They don't seem to make any outgoing payments so collections and accounts receivables are constantly calling asking where their money is. yet, they'll expect client to wire transfer funds within 24 hrs usually, especially if it's the end of the month so the rep can get their bonus to pay rent, bills and groceries. Oh and don't be too successful, because if marcus pays you too much on an incentive/bonus opportunity, he may decide to not do it again. There's no guarantee you'll make as much the following year after a very successful year. And they could care less about how discouraging that is on an employee. You may even deliver the same results each year but if there's a lack of incentives or bonuses being offered, you may earn less which sucks. When you leave, you may not get all of the money you're actually owed. Honestly, the nbc tower isn't that cool of a building to be in. It's a prime location but there's only a mediocre cafe inside the building to get food, and an overpriced illy coffee place. Also, there's no microwave so don't bring anything hot for lunch. They take attendance like you're in high school. There aren't really any benefits. You can pay for healthcare and invest in a 401k through them but other than that, nothing. Not much opportunity for growth as a professional or within the company. They favor men. No female C level executives at this company. no IT security They expect you to do the same thing but deliver new results... You'll likely never see a raise. If you do, it may only be $500-1000 more each year... Advice to Management Evolve. Educate yourself on what the modern business landscape looks like. Pay attention to your competitors. Listen to your clients feedback and ACT ON IT! Be transparent with your prospects. They'll work with you if you build their trust. Your brand is soooo important and if your reputation sucks, which it does, you make it harder to be successful. I'd suggest rebranding entirely. Consumers are smarter than ever before, and they see through your manipulative processes. You offer a great product but you present it terribly and have no interest in making it better. Always strive for better. More money doesn't make it better. Set the tone for mission, vision, and values and be how you want your employees to be like. Appreciate your employees. Don't make them starve financially in one of the most expensive cities because they have a bad month or two selling. INVEST IN TECHNOLOGY AND YOUR EMPLOYEES. BE INNOVATIVE. AND ACTUALLY BE THE BEST!
