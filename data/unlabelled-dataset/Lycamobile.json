I don't even know where to start. Rasism against white people. Literally. I have never seen anything like this. They will not promote anyone who is white except situations when they really don't have a choice. For example, they have a group of Sri Lankans they made them Product Managers. Guys have no clue what is happening, 0 knowledge about their own product. But the most important thing they speak Tamil , rest doesn't matter. They pay less than any other company in the UK! Thy pay peanuts and me personally I had no salary review for 2 years even though I had more and more responsibilities. If you are lucky and they promote you, the probation period is endless. And you may get \u00a360 more after 6 months. Cameras are everywhere. Absolutely everywhere.One is in front of the entrance to the ladies toilette. This company is not only in the UK they have several CC around the world. Usually abroad they don't pay people on time so whoever is there to represent the company gets incredible amount of sh** from people because they think they are also responsible for lack of salaries on their account. When you travel they pay you \u00a315 a day and this huge amount needs to cover transportation, food (sometimes you are lucky if they book you bed and breakfast), and phone. Seriously. \u00a315 a day. If you had any additional expenses you have to wait for 6 months for company to give you money back and you still have no guarantee they will. Sometimes they don't pay for rented flats, hotels on time and ask employees to cover one or two nights by themselves because they have no budgets, so for every single penny they need a sign off. From the whole senior management ! it takes ages! People with no experience, with no skills are being promoted because they are friends with someone who can influence management decisions. They don't invest in employees so if you are looking for career development or any additional courses or training, forget it. Every Friday they organise drinks and food for their stuff but only for certain people Team Leaders or agents are not allowed. Also you have to queue for food and if you are white you will get your portion after all Sri Lankans. Management is drunk almost every day. Many times I met people who smelled like a bottle of vodka and couldn't even pronounce the company's name. At the beginning they were inviting weird looking ladies from outside of the company but have to admit last time I've seen it it was more than a year ago. I think the Chairman is a genius who's surrounded by wrong people. For 2 years I haven't met anyone who's not looking for another job. Good experts are coming and leaving after a week or two. If you want to work in the positive environment, if you are looking for a long term career development, if you want to achieve something it's not a right place for you.
