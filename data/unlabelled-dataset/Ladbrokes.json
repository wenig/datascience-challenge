Certain customers were also allowed late bets which was decided by my MPM which made serving customers very stressful. We were told in security meetings to not do this but management would override this, making you feel you wouldn't have a leg to stand on if security got involved. You would spend the majority of the day on your own, this made toilet breaks very difficult especially during the evening.

If your cashier doesn't turn up then look forward to a 14 hour shift on your own with no break, no attempt is made by management to rectify this and you aren't encouraged to close the shop for an hour to allow time for your break, yet more hours unpaid. There is snobbery in upper management and they aren't afraid to show it to your face when they see you. It's also worth mentioning that several times staff members have been encouraged to take part in \"engagement surveys\" that are \"anonymous\", however you need to say where you work, how old you are and what shifts you do before entering any feedback.

Cons A Customer Service Manager at Ladbrokes holds about the same level of authority as the old folks you see writing down number plates of cars who are driving above 10mph down their hideous country lanes. Don't be fooled into thinking your promotion from a cashier means anything at all. Other employers are not in the slightest bit interested, and rightfully so. It is a dead end job which many of the employees, including myself have been tricked in to doing. You are not a manager, you are a glorified cashier who is paid an extra \u00a31 to do the risky stuff and work 14 hour shifts. If somehow you end up working for Ladbrokes then under no circumstances should you do what I did during my first few months there, which is to work hard, do favours and try and excel. Doing these kind of things will lead to you being asked to do a host of truly ridiculous, thankless favours at a moments notice. You will not any form of incentive, there is no such thing as premium pay, staff whose contracts said so were forced to sign an amendment saying they would happily work for basic pay, and those who outright refused to sign it were banned from overtime. And i'm afraid to say that if you think \"well maybe one day I will be chosen to receive a promotion\", then think again. They will go out of their way to ensure they hire someone who is under-qualified and massively under-experienced for the job. What the senior management do not seem to be able to fathom is that betting shops are not supermarkets or coffee shops. They are a place where the criminals and the down and outs go because there is seating and occasionally a working air-conditioning system. Ladbrokes insisted on trying to implement a service plan whereby the staff would become baristas, councillors, American sales people and a betting shop guru for what is essentially minimum wage. Especially for those non city folk. The concept of offering every customer a free refreshment does not attract the wealthy Chinese business man or the drug dealer looking to launder some money. It attracts the sort of chap who spends his day sitting on a park bench drinking a can of super strong cider who occasionally shouts nonsense at passers by. I don't have anything against these sort of people, but they aren't really going to fill the vast hole in the company's balance sheet. Furthermore the concept of a regular customer is something I find really quite troublesome, especially when the company claims to be responsible and ethical. Someone who comes in to a betting shop regularly is either a pensioner, a laundering criminal or someone who has a gambling problem. The organisation of Ladbrokes from top to bottom is perhaps one of the most ridiculous things I have ever come across. As an example I am still waiting for my P45 having left the company a good few weeks ago. It is genuinely possible that HR has my unopened resignation letter on a desk for a coaster. It gets worse however, a few days ago (baring in mind I left the company several weeks ago) I received a letter from Ladbrokes explaining that further to our disucssion on the 1st August they would be transferring me to a different shop. This sort of thing is standard practice for Ladbrokes, however on the 1st of August I was half way across the world on holiday and therefore couldn't possibly have had a discussion about changing shops. Ladbrokes will openly expect you to breach the working time directive when it suits them. And your right to opt-out of Sundays? Forget about it. Ladbrokes claim that without attending a meeting in the other side of London where you will be pressurised and threatened with cut hours that government guidelines and law are simply meaningless. Finally may I add that as a Customer Service Manager you are expected to clean the shop during the day Advice to Management Come on down from them ivory towers of yours, how in god's name did you get up there? Go out and visit some shops. Not the preposterous concept shops in the West End but actual shops. Do it for the purpose of trying to understand how your business actually operates, not examining shelving for dust. Perhaps do a 14 hour shift on a Saturday, and try and gain a grasp of what actually happens in betting shops. Why not ask armed drug dealers to show you some proof of age? You could spend some time offering cups of sickly brown water to the man who has sold everything including his mother to the local Cash Converter in a bid to reclaim the \u00a320,000 he has lost this week to virtual roulette. Try grinning through the abuse and dodging the spit another satisfied customer directs at you.

There is a tendency to feel very unsafe at work which is unreasonable. In addition, despite not being paid for your lunch hour, it is very difficult to actually get one when you are working alone.

Management- Some members of senior management (not all) do not possess the interpersonal and leadership skills required to lead teams. Some can have an unacceptable lack of respect for front line retail staff. This negatively impacts the productivity in retail shops by draining the motivation and commitment of good staff to the job. Work/life balance- The hours can be very unsociable; including 12 hour shifts, weekends, bank holidays, etc. The days you work are never consistent, they usually change every week. Some people like this but it makes it impossible to make plans. Advice to Management Abolish lengthy consecutive hours of single-manning. It is very dangerous and disruptive.

More specifically, we lost many key profitable customers who enjoy the virtual betting products. I find single-manning counter intuitive to improving turnover and services in shops. Show respect and encouragement to retail staff. They are the bloodline of the company and are the only people who can really improve the profitability of retail shops.

Cons Where do I start....by far the worst company I've ever worked for. Poor infrastructure. Amateur outfit. Would give it 0.5 stars if I could. Lets just say there's a reason why Ladbrokes are pretty much on their knees and going into a nonsensical merger with another retail heavy competitor who carry heavy levels of debt. Considering they fell asleep during the digital betting growth, you'd think they'd merge with a competitor whose digital arm is lucrative. Shops have a limited shelf life. Dermot Desmond was right, it\u2019s a one way merger. What else? Senior management: - are morally bankrupt, inconsiderate, rude, ungrateful, lack basic manners and are self-serving. The word \"thank you\" simply does not exist in their vocabulary. They play favourites and discriminate against other members of staff who they dislike - Lack any respect for their colleagues - Although it's a challenge, you'll get no appreciation for your work. I've never come across anything like it. Zero gratitude. Makes you have no motivation. - To call the communication levels as abysmal would be a gross understatement. Senior management will alter your work, not tell you, resulting in you passing off old versions around the business. Worst of all, when confronted, not even seem apologetic. Simply displaying an arrogant attitude of \"I did it, don't question me, go away\". - No concept of \"we're all one team\". - Mentality of senior management definitely suffers from local culture. - Professional standards of some the senior management levels leave a lot to be desired. The professional qualifications count for nothing. It's a case of \"do it the Ladbrokes way\". Pay - pay scale is so skewed it's unreal. Some are paid way below market rate; others are paid so far above market rate you're left wondering who sets the boundaries and the justification for these salaries. Do these people not have any moral compass??? Stationary - This I found hilarious, on my first day, the stationary cupboard was bare. Got hand me down pads and pens. These are the basics... Systems - uh oh, could be here a while... - This is a FTSE250 company. After day 1, you'll be wondering how they've got that far. The controls are poor! I have no idea how they pass their internal audits. I've seen start ups with better controls and systems. - The lack of investment in the systems has resulted in a situation where you're having to spend hours doing work that a system should have already done for you. - The systems themselves are painfully slow. There's a high staff turnover, but HR don't seem to want to investigate why. Not a meritocratic or rewarding environment. In summary, this is an appalling company to work for. Senior management look out for themselves and do not care about their employees. Do not be attracted to the fact it's a big company. It's like Liverpool FC, a dormant giant who will never make it back to the top and living on past glories. Years of neglect have forced it into the doldrums. Pay is poor, redundancies are coming, and future is not bright. At this point current/ex employees have got a neckache from constantly nodding in agreement whilst reading this Advice to Management Encourage 360 degrees feedback so that employees can tell senior management that they're incompetent at certain aspects of their job. An element of their salary is to MANAGE individuals and the team. Stop lying to your employees.

If you go for a shop level position then they will most likely offer you 15 or so hours a week as a cashier with the \"possibility\" of more, the level of pay is every so slightly above minimum wage so your monthly income will be pittance. As a Cashier you'll mercifully get mainly daytime shifts, however you will have to work most Saturdays as well. Training is mainly on the job and the quality of this is completely down to the manager, you will also have to complete a tedious training book. Once you start the job you'll find out that it is mostly boredom with brief busy moments of activity. During the day you will mainly get a mix of old boys putting on dozens of tiny bets and roulette machine regulars/addicts. Some of these customers are absolutely fine, however there is a significant percentage who will be rude and/or aggressive; get used to people staring at you suspiciously behind the counter (they think you have a little button that makes them lose). Every once in a while one of these will stand up and punch the machine screen in, then they'll either walk out or decide your face is the next target for a punching. If you stay in the job for more than a week, the chances are they will want you to become a Customer Service Manager for a tiny pay rise, which basically translates to Cashier with shop keys. This is where the fun really starts! You will then be asked to work evenings (until 9:30 -10pm) managing the shop, and this will probably be on your own. You will have to deal with an eclectic mix of drunks and problem gamblers, many of whom will decide you are personally responsible for their losses. You will also be responsible for the \u00a31000s on the premises which is an incredibly tempting target for any armed robbers in the area. Some shops have had 3 or 4 armed robberies (although their health and safety reports still read like Disneyland's) and I don't know many people who have been in the industry for more than a couple of years who have not been robbed at gunpoint or knifepoint. The biggest problem is that you are just a very expendable asset to the company, and so they treat you as such. The gambling industry also loves to downplay the negative things that happen on its premises, there is a VERY strong culture of non-reporting of incidents as the companies don't want their premises linked with crime. I have seen staff members physically threatened by customers and it not even be reported to the company let alone Police. This all makes betting shops magnets for crime and criminals, in the last few years there has been one staff member murdered and one raped in Ladbrokes premises, the latter receiving basically no media coverage. However, each shop is different and everyone's experience is different, for example, I know people that love the job, make up your own mind! Advice to Management Treat staff with dignity and respect.

I would recommend this job especially to any current or prospective students based on the flexibility, dependent on base shop location. A plus point is also Ladbrokes competitive wage for CSM's. At a young age and on a part time basis you would be hard pressed to find better than \u00a38.31 an hour. Cons On the most part customers can be very friendly and quite often become a friend for life but there are the exceptions who can make your life a complete misery. A lot of betting stores on the high street are closely located to pubs, customers losing a lot of money and being drunk can make for some aggressive situations especially at later hours. Which leads me to my next criticism, single manning hours at night. Although I did not personally feel unsafe during my time working late hours alone at ladbrokes I consider this an unnecessary risk and a possible accident waiting to happen. My next point would be the long working hours. Even in light of the new working hours \"5 over 7\" where colleagues would not work over 8.5 hours a day, I still found myself working full shifts from half 8 in the morning to just after 10 at night. While this doesn't seem too bad as a one off occasion, working 2 or 3 of these shifts can make for a very stressful and demoralizing environment .
