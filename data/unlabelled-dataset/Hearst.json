Cons The Hearst tech team, especially on the product side, desperately needs leadership that has experience in product development on the social media or ad tech side. Knowing the ecosystem in those fields, as well as having deep knowledge and experience in agile is crucial. The culture that manifests with poor management or experience in modern tech fosters less than par developers, hierarchies and cliques that mirror the outdated cultural model to that of publishing. Advice to Management Two pieces of advice: 1. Act like a tech environment and be open. It definitely is there, but there is room for improvement especially when it comes to transparency. 2. Bring in leaders or employees from social media, major ad networks or startups that provide B2B services, to lead Hearst Product and culture into the 21st century.
