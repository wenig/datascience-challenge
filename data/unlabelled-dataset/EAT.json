Possibilities of carreer progression (dependent on shop, manager, and luck). Altough, being a manager can be very tough, with no help from the company, so I'm not sure if this counts as 'pro'. Cons I have worked many years with the company. The job was hard, and not for everybody, but that was to be expected. What isn't, is that the company wasn't helping its people at all - in fact, made it harder for them to do their job. There are scarsely enough people at the shops (and it was getting worse-and-worse during my employement), yet the expectations from the staff are higher and higher. I've spent countless hours working for free: if I had to open the shop, and I wanted to do it on time, I had to get there half an hour earlier. When I have closed the shop, it took at least half an hour extra to the things which were minimally required. We could not even have dreamt about having some extra time to do deep cleaning, or to tidy up with paperwork. While the management smiled in our faces, they have actually treated us as we were totally incompetent: they have micromanaged every little aspect of how we do our job, and acted as it was our laziness that we could not cope with the amount of work that has to be done. Also, because we cannot use our common sense but had to listen of how we should run the shop, our job was much harder (of course we could not afford to listen to them in everything, if we do everything as they wanted us to do, that would have been a disaster). Simply there isn't enough people and time to do things by the book, we had to cut corners if wanted to keep up with the peace. And it's not like that if I was slow: all my colleagues, during all those years, have faced the same problems. When I have joined, there were separate positions for team member, barista, kitchen leader etc. My manager didn't even let me on the coffee machine in the first two weeks. Now, every newcomer is required to do a lot more from the beginning. There is even a position called shift runner, when the person have to act as the shop manager, when the real one is not here (and that is not for extreme cases, but on a regular, every day basis, unless the manager is willing work from dusk till dawn). This shift runner position gives a slight increase in pay for those hours when the person is the acting manager. The trick is, anyone can be a shift runner, almost straight from the street, after a two session training and the test. This not only sounds chaotic, but it is: to be an effective store manager, people need valuble experience, which they can gain in years. Putting junior people into these positions seems like a desperate attempt from the company to cut costs. There are shops that are without a manager for months, and being run by baristas, floor managers, shift runners, people, who don't get recongnition for their effort - it is expected from them. The area managers can see, what is going on, but they don't / not allowed to do anything about it. In fact, they don't want to report that things in their area are not going good, because the company doesn't like those who dare to open their mouth about what is happening. Also, why expecting us to do all our job, they don't help us at all. I have heard about a shop, where on langer out of the two was not working and have not been serviced for over a week! Temperature was a yearly issue in the summer, as the air conditioning unit would have to replaced. Every summer, when we started complaining about temperatures over 30-35 degrees Celsius (even more in kitchen), the company was stalling for time until the summer was over. Finally, after many years, it have been replaced. I was taking it more-or-less allright, but my colleagues were not good with high temperatures. On occassion we asked our area manager if we can put a standing fan from Argos, to help us out on the tills during lunchtime. Our request was denied, citing that the fan did not fit into the shops image. Of course, our area manager did not have to work his back off every day in that heat. During the years I have also seen, how things were taken away (altough this happens everywhere): first, full time people were contracted 40 hours, that went down to 35 (they still work 40, or even more hours, but when they go on holiday, they will only get payed for their contracted hours). First we had access to food, iced drinks, now even the battled water has been taken away (yes, we were asked to pay for battled water if did not wanted to drink from the tap). It wasn't better for the shop managers, either: my manager had to cancel her holiday multiple times, because the company refused to give us more people to help out, citing that our budget won't allow it. That is another point: when I've started, people got bonus based on a mistery shopper programme. Every shop had equal chance, we just had to be nice to customers. Simple. Then, they took it away for at least a year, and later re-introduced another programme: a given shop had to beat it's target budget by 5%, so that people can get bonus. My shop was unable to even reach the budget because of the incresed competition around us, and because, with less and less people to serve customers, nobody wanted to stand in long queues and have chosen the competition instead (which made matters progressively worse). So, despite working hard, I haven't had any bonus for years. The screening process for new applicants is also inadequate. Shop managers cannot choose, who ever they want to work with, instead they will get who ever has been sent from the head office. The screening process focuses on how cool and relaxed people look, and not on how sincere or hardworking they will be. Because of this, I have seen many new candidates who should never have been allowed to work with us, and I'm sure that many people who would have been a great help have been declined, just because they were not so chatty and not having a big mouth. Also, the company employs many store managers who are treating their staff very bad, and unless they do something extreme, there is now way they will be removed. Since the company rewards those managers who make the numbers, some managers are willing to go very far, and make their people suffer (but, I'm sure that this happens with other companies, too). One time we had to go to the head office for some sort of training. They told us that 'Now you can finally tell us how to do things better, we listen to your opinion!\". What they did was, they have given us a paper where we had to do give at least 5 reasons of what is essential to be a customer host. Now, this is how much they care about our opinion, and how ridiculous can they be, instead of helping us by giving us more people to work with. Well, they treat as very nicely, but they also turn their backs on us. And also, we are expected to be happy all time, regardless of what is happening. People who dare to complain about their daily struggles, are unpopular ,and if they happen to be shop managers,they can expect lots of nagging from management and area managers. Also, managerial positions are quite shaky: since most managers don't have the resources to do everything by the book, random inspections can turn out to be very bad for them, and after a couple for those, the company has every right to get rid of them. So most people just force their biggest smile when they have to deal with their superiors - they not going to get help anyway. Things have turned noticably worse after the owners decided to sell the company out for investors. There are countless many things, which I'm not going put here. Also, for fairness, I have to say, that not all shops are the same. In some shops, its better, in some places, it might be even worse. The places I have worked, it was bad. Every collague, who left my shop, felt relieved once they have stopped working for EAT, including me. I have seen countless people come and go, but literally there is not single person whom I know and has any fond memories of the time spent there. I would say that every day I have spent there, was a struggle. I guess that says it all.

The company sets unreacheable targets to the shops, and listens to no advise or opinions from shop managers or employees. They are keep cutting the paid hours, so basicly one person will have more and more thing to do.

And if you are not finished, you are expected to stay and work unpaid to finish everything. You will not know your shifts in advamce, sometimes only a day before. It means that if you are open 7 days a week, you just simply can not plan any freetime activity. Also, it is common, that you are in the closing team, you finish late evening (8-10pm), and next day you have to be there, opening the shop at 5-6am.
