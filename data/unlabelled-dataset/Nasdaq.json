There were a lot of benefits that came with the job (because of the connections to major public companies, we also received discounts and perks at these places).

Cons I was promised many things (advancement opportunities, job expectations, total salary, lowest commission possible, etc) in the interview process and none of it turned out to be true. (This also happened with many other people I worked with- we all ended up leaving MUCH better paying jobs based on these false expectations) We were taught all these 'amazing' things about the products I sold but, after talking with real users in the market place, seeing competitors' products, and trying to demo our products, I realized they are some of the worst and are in no way competitive (in quality or price). I personally came in with a lot of experience but they offer no support or real training. Because of this, I saw many colleagues who came in with less experience struggle and fail miserably as they tried to figure things out on their own. The overall morals that are held and encouraged by management are atrocious. You are fully expected to try to pull the wool over clients' eyes to make any sell and are supported if you get caught stealing deals from colleagues. The two things I heard most often were \"Ask for forgiveness, not for permission,\" and \"I don't have morals when it comes to business.\" I see no strength in the company itself- they constantly just buy up-and-coming start-ups, sell said start-ups products without improving or growing said start-up's products, until these products are no longer competitive and eventually die. They believe they will be successful completely based on the notion of \"It will sell because we're NASDAQ,\" albeit my previous statement and the fact that NASDAQ is only really known in the listings market. Advice to Management Create a better internal culture. Hold people accountable for not just numbers but for the rules set forth by the company.

Each year titles are renamed, groups are volleyed back and forth between senior managers in the name of \"growth\" \"efficiency\" \"synergy\" This leads to an unfortunate loss of direction each time a reorganization/management shift occurs in the technology organization. Despite these shifts, the groups and the organizational process/workflow/structure have remained relatively unchanged. The same groups talk to each other to get the same work accomplished. Rather than the Greens talking to the Yellows, it simply shifts to the Oranges talking to the Browns in title only. It is very similar to the observation that mergers fail due to organizational processes not meshing together. - A technology company severely incapacitated by the recent corporate culture of defendable decisions since the technology issues of the largest IPO. e.g. \"No one ever got fired for hiring IBM.\" This has mainly led to the culture comprised of skilled, agile teams, capable of building solutions, to incapable teams that have lost their top talent to turnover. The policies put forth make for a severely demoralizing & demotivating a workforce that's otherwise tremendously capable. This makes for a fairly oppressive work environment and a structure that engenders mistrust. A small bit of sanity comes from the small alliances that are forged amongst the Romeos & Juliets of groups at odds with each other. - Senior management is severely disconnected from the ground floor workers as they are incapable of dog-fooding the products & policies they put forth. As many know, an idea does not sell itself, but the hard work and attention to detail make the difference. By pushing policies in the name of leaving a legacy, resume bullet point, or being a yes-man, relationships & respect are broken. - ADHD inducing distractions. Being an open setup, there's a tremendous lack of ability to focus on a task at hand. Advice to Management Bob G asks at group lunches, \"What can we do to improve our company?\" When most of the employees are speechless, it's not that there aren't any improvements to make, it's that they are paralyzed from speaking as they don't know where to begin. - Our salaries reflect that we are a knowledge workforce rather than a labor workforce. The most important competitive advantage of a knowledge workforce is the cultivation and management of that knowledge & critical thinking base. Top talented engineers make great team leads, however are very unlikely to be good managers. - Stop reorganizing the company. History has shown that war has not been a struggle over territory as much as the battle for a shift in power. As different heads continue to battle for territory, it's a reflection of individuals shifting their priorities from EXCELLENCE to SELF-PRESERVATION. As management's focus shifts to self-preservation, competitive edge is lost as top talent decides that their sanity is more important than the compensation package. - Focus on building & forging employee relationships rather than relying on top-down edicts of how employees should work. Build a collaborative environment where minds can mesh. Google about the design of the Bell Labs Hallway. When it comes to fixing problems, there are 2 types of consultants. Ones that are looking to bill you for putting on a show, and ones that understand that the individuals best suited to fixing an organization are the individuals within it. The latter consultant merely facilitates the process of finding the individuals capable of a finding a fix and facilitating that fix. - Invest in infrastructure and building environments capable of being tested during work hours rather than during the weekends.

Two is that sometimes you'll finish a project on time, and it works well, but the sales side can't figure out how to sell it and it will die on the vine. I also wouldn't classify the company as Entreprenurial. The technical support staff leaves a lot to be desired as well. I was alsways dumbfounded at the lack of familiarity the support staff has with the product lines that customers are calling in for.

Does that guy even know what company he works for? Is there any standardization at all going on with call scripts? Advice to Management I would try and untangle the data products business line from the market data side. They, by design of the organization, have been placed directly at odds with each other. As a result, there is fierce competition between the two groups to the point of duplicated efforts, poached sales lists, and anti-productivity. I've even gotten the notion on some calls that one line will intentionally not release a product even if it's a good idea and has a solid business case just because they don't want to deal with the other. In my opinion, one solution to this problem would be to merge the groups. The marketing group also may need to be decentralized but controlled by a small group to ensure that the efforts from each product line adhere to branding starndards and a unified marketing message. What's going on now is that it's so locked down and centralized that it's almost impossible to get a both accurate and creative market message out regarding a new product. The marketing area should also be responsible for the analysis of the statistical data generated from the marketing vehicles that are being used. There is pretty much no standardization of the way market collects this data across the marketing vehicles to judge things like response rates to certain types of advertising, visits and user data from the various websites (and there are many). Again, this is only my opinion, but there doesn't seem to be a solid handle on all of the market data points coming into the company from all of the marketing venues. This is severely hindering the cross sellability of all exisiting gproducts as well as the impact of getting new customers roped in. There is also a lot of money being spent by the marketing team to outsource the creation of a lot of the verious ad materials and not enough time spent talking to the customers/business lines/technology side to get a handle on what the product actually sells to the customer so an effective marketing piece can be created. This area needs to be revamped. Technology is also a little dicey, but not nearly as bad as it could be. It's biggest threat is (and probably always will be) that there is a culture of \"my way is the right way\" and it centers around job security. If there was a reward system in place for rewarding innovation rather than empire building, that may help. Also, there is a clear tactic that seems to have gotten a lot of traction (right before I left anyway) which was used by some senior managers on the technology side This tactic would be to create a crisis and then solve it in order to remain visible. It seems that visibility is where the pot of gold lies for the management and staff. This leads to stress on the empployees (which could account for the low morale in some way and wasted money in the form of hours spent solving problems that are blown out of proportion.

Cons #1 NASDAQ don't like to support or encourage employees to take any external training programs. I have never got any technical training from the company after more than 5 years service. the only training you will get here is how the current products work and how they are built. #2 They have yearly salary review but nothing is really being reviewed. You take more and more responsibilities along the years, but every year you will only get the standard pay rise which buys you 1 coffee per month. Well it does depend on your position and how important you are to the company. For the Sydney office, some important people(mostly management people) get paid pretty well including all middle level management team. but for normal engineers who probably do the most dev work, the salary is much lower than the market. #3 It is very hard to get any budget/resource for improving developers' productivities. For example, it is hard to get approved to get tools we need to improve CI/CD, version control, building tools etc. as long as it is not directly linked to company's yearly GOALs, it is very hard to get approved. #4 Some early 90s technologies are still the main stream in NASDAQ SYD. management are not motivated to refresh it since that probably doesn't improve the bonus and it always comes with risk of losing their jobs. #5 Different teams will point fingers at each other when things go wrong. Sometimes some people can go very aggressive. #6 As engineers, you won't be trusted unless you showcased you are absolutely a genius to the management or you are being good friend to management.

Nice work space generally quiet enough to work in peace. You will meet a lot of knowledgeable and friendly people (And some that aren't as inclined, same with every company). There is generally a lot to learn and improve on (for my role at least). The culture is very relaxed and most people can get away with super casual clothing. Employee benefits are a key human-resource drive in this company - Monthly drinks, higher than standard super, health insurance coverage, employee 'rewards' as well as fruit and biscuits available for your daily needs. Cons Nasdaq offers what is widely considered substandard pay. The disparity in payment between upper management and mid-level employees is far too big of a gap. Since the hierarchy is increasingly flattened, it becomes more and more of an issue amongst employees with many of the talented staff leaving for better opportunities elsewhere. Nasdaq doesn't seem to care too much about retaining anyone - they often replace loyal multi-year employee's with a mediocre entry-level hiree's for the purpose of budget. Most of us are made to feel disposable. Moving up and getting promoted here is nothing short of difficult and sometimes impossible. Since the structure is so flat, most of us only have a couple of jumps before managerial level If you do push hard enough you might get lucky but don't expect a significant jump in your salary. The unfairness becomes apparent when years on, employees with significant experience and knowledge are earning the same or even less than new hires. It makes it hard to see a long term future at NASDAQ. Your career 'path' here is more like a career 'step'. We rely on old legacy tools and processes that are due for a complete remake, but instead gets a bunch of periodic ad-hoc, band-aid fixes since it's cheaper but a total disaster in the long term. There's a lot of finger pointing when things go wrong when the process all together can often be a circus act. Documentation is seriously lacking. Most people retain information and as soon as they leave, that information goes with them. You get a lot of specialization that could be spread beyond one employee but that's hardly the case and I have no idea why. Potential employees of NASDAQ need to be okay with old-school autocratic culture and expect that moving up and implementing change is a long and difficult process. Advice to Management Management need to relax the \"it's just business\" motive and remember the importance of retaining employees who are the building blocks of the company. Treat them as invaluable and listen to the common consensus that career paths here are not clear and that promotions are far too difficult to attain.

Cons Since the takeover from New York, previous social events and great environment have become all too politicised as senior management seems to struggle for more power, while structure starts to spread gap between senior management and the regular employee. A slowly sinking ship at the moment, anyone with any good experience/skill sets is jumping ship quick, while everyone left try and get the water out of the ship. Huge turnover rate of anyone with skill. Very political promotion structure. Management doesn't do well with struggling employees, people severely underperforming seem to not be correctly dealt with. As another review states once you get a job you're most likely to keep it which is great for those who want job security, but it means the people you're working with aren't scared of bad performance and due to the poor promotional procedures they won't bother to work on it. It causes a lot of averagely made ad-hoc solutions as no-one is willing to take the extra step to fix processes and issues. Say they pay for performance yet pay rises are like getting blood from a stone. General consensus internally is that compensation is low despite the workloads and the somewhat false reputation that NASDAQ pays well. Pay rises come few and far between so ensure your start pay is high enough to start with. Some mid management are clearly only in positions due to being staying with the company for a long time, but are lacking any actual management skills and some are still less skilled than employees in their team.
