My Superdrug has an incredibly lovely team,everyone works together and is relatively on the same level ( with the exception of our manager) Staff discount is fantastic,I get everything so cheap which makes things easier at home. Lunch and breaks are given very generously on long shifts Cons Superdrug is near constant stress and pressure.My first day left me welling up with tears because they left me on the till all on my own,with little to no knowledge of what I was doing,and it was also a pretty busy day. All of the paperwork required for me starting was sent off unbelievably late,which prevented my name being put on payroll.I worked a whole two months before I was actually paid,which made me so angry.I couldn't believe they where that disorganised. The team leader was a big bully who had no interest in adapting to changes within the company.She would constantly swear on shop floor and speak negatively about other members of staff behind their backs.I reported her to management and nothing was done about the situation. All the company cares about is Star buys and beauty cards,and they pressure you so much into forcing them upon people who really don't care.They believe it makes people want to come back but I believe otherwise.I have failed two mystery shops because I didn't ask the thousand questions you have to squeeze in at till point.As soon as I failed my first one I was pulled into the office and shouted at by my assistant manager,who said I had cost him his bonus and that the 50% result was disgusting.I felt like not coming back to work ever again.I failed another one recently and I was told there would be consequences if it where to happen again. Now I live in dread till the next time ito comes along. It didn't seem to matter to them how well I perform on a daily basis,I usually kick everyone else's butts at selling fragrance and registering cards but as soon as you make one single mistake you a treated like rubbish. I'm also very sick of being called up in the early hours of the morning asking if I can come in or start earlier as they are that god damn unorganised and understaffed.My manager will set up all the rotas for the next couple of weeks and I will make note of them straight away,but then she goes ahead and writes me in on extra days - one without asking permission and two without even notifying me!! What if I had plans that day??? They expect you to not have a life outside of work so that you can show up at their beckoned call! Then when you say no because you have made plans the get mad at you and start acting weird around you when you come in on shift. Management are all over the place with everything,not just the rotas.When cashing up,mistakes are constantly being made,so you end up having to stay way after you shift ends to correct their errors.Sometimes they don't even pay you the extra time you do.Some weeks you have tonnes and tones of hours and others you barely have any.When on shift,you can spend hours just stood there at the till or on first aisle while the others do tasks,because management are useless at rotating. Our store is grotty and dirty and the company won't pay out for updates.Our staff room and staff toilet are filthy and untidy and smell like Mildew.You don't have room to swing a cat in them. The pay is incredibly poor for the work you put in.Running a place on their wages is impossible. Don't even think of having time off sick.They get so arsey with you if you ring in and then you have to go through a return to work meeting.I've only had three days off due to bad illness and they are already giving me warnings. There is also barely any chance to progress whilst working at Superdrug. I have come to hate working here despite my love for the job when I first started. Advice to Management Stop putting so much pressure on staff and create a more relaxed environment.Maybe then staff would actually want to come to work. Allow staff to do their job in their own uniquexperience style instead of stifling it with this Mary Goeber rubbish and unless quotas. Improve working conditions Get more organised with rotas.Put more people in if you think there's any chance you will be under staffed instead of ringing people on their day off at unconceivable hours and getting angry with them when they can't make it.Spread hours out more evenly amongst staff members. Be more encouraging and create a system to reward good work. Hire better people senior staff members.

Staff are expected to act as store detectives and get questioned if thefts go up.CCTV is used to watch staff as well as customers They wonder why sales drop but customers come into an empty shop now with no one to help them,instead of the happy shop it used to be.

Constantly phoned by management at early hours on your day off to ask if you can cover. There is too much pressure to sell Starbuys and register beauty cards with absolutely no incentive and if you don't meet their unrealistically high target then you get negative talks by management. Management aren't organised at all the rotas are a mess and you never know what shift you're working as they change it daily this makes planning a life impossible as you end up coming into work on the wrong days as they never give you an updated version of the weekly rota. If you work any overtime sometimes they don't pay you for this overtime. Constantly short staffed usually one person is left on tills for 4 hours straight as the team leaders and managers are useless at rotating. The team leaders all have this attitude of entitlement and constantly look down on everyone else, they never go on tills as they feel it's beneath them only if an assistant manager asks them to. Team leaders are rude and create bad atmosphere feels very threatening and almost bullying. When you don't meet their targets of for example registering 20 cards EVERYDAY then you are taken to the office to have a \"talk\" so basically a bollocking even though you ask every customer. Weekends are the worst as nobody wants to work Sunday so they make the same people work EVERY Sunday as they don't complain and they only get half an hour break for working over 8 hours legally it should be an hour. Honestly never ever work here!
