The Local Media Division has been impacted the most seeing cuts in all departments. The employees remaining have been saddled with picking up the slack and additional work load increasing the margin for error on multiple fronts while not seeing any bump in compensation.

While changes such as these continue to take place, moral inside the Local Media Division continues to deteriorate across the country. The only way Univision can start to repair the Local Media Division is to reinvest in their people and provide fair and adequate compensation. In addition they need to add necessary resources for positions that are essential to doing the job in such a way that benefits their clients. Advice to Management Employees need to be given the option of taking a survey that allows them to rate leadership at all levels and compensation plans.
