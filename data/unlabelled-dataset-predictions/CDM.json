On average, about 90% of the CDs at CDM had grown up in the creative department. That made for a large group of creatives who didn\u2019t know what they didn\u2019t know. I had witnessed first hand what happened to those who had the courage to leave on their own to try their skills at other shops. The great majority ended up crawling back home to the mother ship. The town hall was beginning. The president of CDM stepped onto a 6 foot diameter by 1 foot tall platform, which made him only about 2 inches taller than the average human. Pacing back and forth and holding the mic with what appeared to be a death grip, he touted the agency's achievements from the previous quarter, rambling on and on while throwing in some more self-congratulatory mumbo jumbo that bored me into a daydream. I found myself drifting and wondering about making better use of my talents at an agency that \"gets it\". A shop with creative leaders who weren't preoccupied with reassuring themselves of their \"leadership\" abilities by needing to refer to themselves as leaders every chance they got, as if repeating it over and over out loud somehow made it true. I wondered, if this is what it's like to belong to the Church of Scientology. Suddenly the president of CDM said something that snapped me out of my fantasy of Tom Cruise and I saving the world from an evil genius plotting to brainwash all clients everywhere to run nothing but banner ads. \"You know, it takes a special kind of person to work here at CDM. We don't just hire anybody, so you should all consider yourselves special\u2014part of the chosen few. But, (followed by a very deliberate and long pause) if it turns out you're not one of us, we'll find you, and you won't be here for long.\" Wait just a freakin' minute here. Did he really just say that out loud to the entire CDM staff, including HR, or did I imagine it? So as nonchalantly as possible, I turned to the people on either side of me and then behind me to check for reactions from my fellow co-workers. What I saw, scared the hell out of me. There were no reactions. None at all, as if everything was normal. Just blank, staring-into-space, open-mouthed expressionless faces mimicking the theater audience from the infamous Apple 1984 commercial. Clearly, it was too late for my fellow Scientologists. Luckily for me though, I hadn't drank from the CDM water cooler and I slipped out of there just in time, maintaining complete control of what truly belonged to me. My substance, style, conviction and grace. Not theirs. But most of all I left with my soul, dignity and free will. Here's the deal with CDM. It's a nice place to work if you're just starting out, have no sense of purpose or you're ready to join that cult you've always dreamed of. CDM will be there, ready and willing to mold you into the exact likeness of it's very creepy self. But, if you happen to be an independent thinker who's firmly grounded in a belief system of what makes for great work based on your own proven history of success, you're going to offend, challenge (not in a good way) and make the nice, although misdirected folks over at CDM very uncomfortable. So think it over. If however you do choose to sign on that dotted line, then good luck to you. And whatever you do, don't drink the water. Advice to Management Keep on living the dream.

Cons There is very little management oversight and discipline at all levels within the organization. Account staff are given all of the staff\/resources whereas all other groups are understaffed and overworked. In many cases, the focus is on pleasing the client rather than collaborating as a team. As such, work tends to be dumped on non-Account staff, sometimes with little notice or respect. And, when one makes an effort to accommodate last minutes requests, there is usually no gratitude for being a team player. While there are some protocols in place, they are only followed occasionally, which leads to confusion, miscommunication, etc. Also, there is a very negative, catty culture, and in many cases, the worst offenders are not chastised (and in some cases they are actually promoted). I've seen and heard of numersou employees crying because of such rude, uncalled behavior. Turnover for the organization is not surprisingly very high. Advice to Management Lead by good example. Be genuine. Create a collaborative, positive working environment.","title":"Chaotic, disorganized, catty","prediction":"collaboration"},{"advice":"Distribute work evenly, and make sure to communicate.
