They're implementing 'modern Waitrose' whereby you just keep getting pulled from doing a job on one section to do a job on another (whether you're trained or not) because the section managers can't plan. You then return to your original job (eventually) to find yourself getting a telling off for not having done it quickly enough (or at all). One branch rota. There isn't space for me to tell you all that's bad about that! Suffice to say, its not working. To save money they don't recruit until people leave (school age heading to Uni - happens every year at the same time and they know it does) so you end up short staffed, underpaid and overworked.
