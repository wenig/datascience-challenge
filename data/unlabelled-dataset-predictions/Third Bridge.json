For the extremely underpaid salary that you make at this company, the hours are simply not worth it. - Employees are treated like children. For example there is a sign in sheet to the bathrooms because there is an employee who keeps leaving feces on the floor intentionally. -Constantly micromanaged by tiers of micromanagers. It is how the company operates and something that is holding back a lot of employees from their full potential. - The proprietary software the company uses is trash. Upper management spends too much time, effort, and money developing this product with people who barely know a thing and are extremely under qualified to be leading software development. There is constant outages with this internal software and glitches that are fixed on a daily basis which slows down the entire work force. -With too many people leaving the company and a bad environment being created, there is no chance the company has what it takes to compete with its major competitors.

Pay your people more. Young professionals are money motivated. There is no shot you can develop leaders in the company if there aren\u2019t enough people who stay with Third Bridge long enough because their salary is so under market value.

I know it sounds like fluff but it is not. Cons Two categories of cons: The first is for you as an employee, the second is for the company more broadly (which will impact you as an employee). Category 1 -WARNING: THE TITLE OF THIS JOB IS EXTREMELY MISLEADING. If you take this role you are NOT a research analyst, but rather a recruiter who occasionally does some very shallow research when the need arises. In the interview, you do a \"value chain\" breakdown for a given industry but rarely actually break down a value chain for an industry in practice. -You are a call scheduler. Get used to it. This means that 10000 and 1\/2 factors outside of your control can impact how many calls you set up in a given month and yes it will affect your bonus if things don't go right. -You don't make overtime. This would be fine if the company were serious about its commitment to \"work life balance,\" but when they want you to work on weekends \/stay late so that they can hit their bonuses, they struggle to show \"what's in it for you\" if you are (remarkably) not naturally motivated by how many calls you set up for clients. -Instead of overtime, there is the world's most convoluted bonus structure aimed at getting you to prioritize short-term call-generation quotas that are evaluated by each month. Makes you competitive with everyone you work with and really brings out the worst in people. -Many people you work with are really just not that bright. I had a book on my desk and an AVP who noticed said \"wow! You read a lot of books!\" (emphasis on books). Someone else thought Yemen was in Central Europe. And guess what? They do very well at the job. Proves that you don't need brains to do well. Category 2 -Mismatch between client best interests and personal target hitting. Clients (at least in funds) don't care about doing a 10 mediocre calls with you a week or 5 good ones, as long as they're the right ones. But 10 calls brings in more revenue for the company so guess which one you're incentivized towards. -Obsession with numbers in an industry that is extremely hard to quantify. Metrics for everything. Targets and goals by which you are evaluated, 80% of which are outside of your control ---> makes for some dumb strategy \/ strategic thinking. -Lol @ compliance to \"prevent private information from being shared on the calls.\" -Sales \/ account mgmt is as though someone copy\/ pasted the same low-IQ white guy 20 times and put some khakis on him. Except for like 2 people or so. -Culture of competition breeds gossip on all levels of management, which makes for a \"cliquey\" high school culture at times with no transparency. Extremely frustrating. Advice to Management Change title of job to \"Recruitment Analyst\" or \"Expert Network Analyst.\" Align clients' longer term interests with your own not just for the review of management but also for the people on the ground as well, i.e., if you must have a target system, make it quarterly or annual. Make it possible to receive promotions or other \"awards\" etc. without relying so heavily on numbers. Reduce the culture of cliquy-ness by increased transparency \/ stop obsessing over appearances of uniformity. Reduce turnover by making it alright to be a Research Analyst \/ Senior Associate for longer periods of time without giving the impression that you need to move up or get out. This would entail pay raises (I know, \"margins are important,\" etc. but the rest of the financial sector does them so my sympathy is limited).

Target systems do not account for short months, economic impact, or holidays. Management does not seem to know how to scale a business and does a poor job receiving feedback or criticism. Things change very slowly and the attitude is overwhelmingly \"this is just how things are done\" rather than having the will to innovate. Perhaps this is why margins are so low in the business. Depending on your team leader, you can either have a good or abysmal experience. Team leaders very much play favorites and you're expected to be a cheerleader for the firm. Any criticism of the business or business model is dismissed. The firm rarely hires management level or senior level people from other firms and only promotes internally.

Advice to Management - Hire some people with actual management experience to be VPs and TLs. - Stop hiring grads from top universities, all you do is make them miserable and you really do not need to have the brightest people in the country working for you, let them do something worthwhile. - Change the job title from \u2018research analyst\u2019 to \u2018analyst\u2019. The way the industry works means that no one ever has the time to research anything. - Sort out client allocations. The account managers have quarterly targets for each client, why is this not used to make sure everyone in the Connections team gets a fair amount of business and a fair shot of hitting their targets? - If your employees ask questions like the one above in a Q&A session, don\u2019t threaten to move them to another team. You haven\u2019t answered the question and you come across as childish. - Sort out identity crisis #1 (internal): are you a serious workplace or a company full of kids? The VPs and TLs expect everyone to take their jobs seriously but how can employees do that if you put on monthly socials where everyone gets trashed and then have TLs coming in at 11am the next day? - Sort out identity crisis #2 (external): the clients are never going to see Third Bridge as a research partner, because the people who stay at Third Bridge long enough to meet clients just aren\u2019t that impressive.

The work culture at TB is downright unhealthy. Expect institutionalised micromanagement, and constant surveillance and chasing from your bosses. To give you an idea, every single hour of work has to be accounted for, to the minute. And you get no say in what you actually spend your time on. Essentially, you come in the morning, get your orders, input them in the system, get monitored all day, and before leaving you must show proof that you did all the tasks initially inputted. Its beyond Kafkaian. \u2022 The hours: Not incredibly long (9 to 6:30) but zero flexibility and very intense. When they say 9am it\u2019s 9am not 9:02. You will get told of for coming one or two minutes late. You will also never, ever, have time to check your phone or have a chat during work hours. \u2022 The work culture, part 2: As of June, listening to music (even with earphones) has been outlawed. So don\u2019t expect to put on a tune whilst you\u2019re scrolling down 15 pages of LinkedIn profiles. Beyond Kafkaian. \u2022 The work culture, part 3: There is a lot of backstage politicking and factions within the workforce.

Third Bridge says it pays its employees a competitive wage but this is a complete lie: Both OTE and base salary are far lower than industry average. You need to stay at least 8-9 months before you earn a decent bonus (if you are doing well and have not resigned). By this point, you will have helped the company make 10x the amount they paid you. =>MINCROMANAGED: You will have a review every single month which will often be complete character assassination. Some employees have been told to change their personality while others have been told that their bathroom breaks are a little too long. These reviews are usually just there for Third Bridge to pressure you into bringing more revenue in while cutting costs. This brings me to my next point: =>PRESSURE ON COST-CUTTING: Your employees find it unbelievably hypocritical that you are asking them to keep costs as low as possible while paying them as little as possible. The CEO loves to brag about how great EBITDA and margins are but feels no remorse about paying his over-qualified staff a minimal wage. =>NO WORK LIFE BALANCE: You will be expected to work long hours and every minute of your day will be accounted for. If you decide to leave at 6 every day, you will be managed out. The same applies if you do not come into work at least 10 minutes early each day. =>MANAGEMENT: There are a few good people in managerial positions. However, all managers on the research floor have simply climbed through the ranks. The result is that those who are team leaders at Third Bridge are those that thrived in the toxic environment and stayed long enough to get promoted. They usually got promoted because they were the only ones left. ---------- ---------- FINAL NOTE: Overall this is not a real job. You are neither a researcher, nor an analyst. If you are a creative person or if you have an ounce of intellectual curiosity you will quickly get very bored. You will be repeating the same steps across every single \u2018research\u2019 project: -\u2018Project\u2019 comes in. This consists of a list of companies and a few qualifying questions -You check the internal data base to see if anyone is available to answer those questions\/has worked at those companies. If so you schedule a conference call which you are not allowed to join. - If not, you will have to scan through pages of Linkedin\/other recruitment tools and spam\/cold call as many people as possible until someone agrees to have a discussion on that industry with your client for as little as possible, while charging the client an exuberant rate. -Repeat. It is not uncommon that confidential information is shared during these conversations and you will often feel like Third Bridge and its competitors are operating in somewhat of a grey area.

You get to speak with very interesting people, CEOs etc of huge multinational companies Cons where to start.. 1. Pay is awful, you are essentially expected to make 10-13k a month for the first 3 months for the company. Dependant on your role RA1, RA2, Associate, Senior Associate you are expected to make 13k, 25k, 36k, 40k ish for the company PER MONTH and you barely see 30k a year which is very unfair, yes there are bonuses but they do not compare and are often very low. In a very good month as an Associate you would make maybe 1k. 2. Team leaders are young, usually become a TL after a year or two in the role are all around 25 and managing 6-8 people. Literally \"the blind leading the blind\". VPs are no better. 3. New initiatives are constantly being rolled out, never standardized and never around long enough to see if they actually work or not 4. Very high turnover rate 5. Boring and very repetitive work 6. Mircomanaged to the max, you have to show what you are working on every hour of the day and the whole office can see it. 7. Constantly giving \"feedback\". 90% of the time you don't know what you're supposed to do with it, the feedback you give is never really taken seriously (note all glassdoor reviews for example, nothing has changed and management is fully aware of them). Team Leaders have to give feedback monthly, even if you are doing things well they have to find things wrong and give feedback on it. 8. No loyalty. You are never safe from being fired people that have been there for over 2 years that have consistently performed are terrified of not hitting targets for even a month or two in fear of being fired.

Your colleagues will almost all be interesting, intelligent, fun and just overall nice to be around. - The job offers quick progression as long as you perform strongly. You can expect to be promoted every 3-4 months. The promotions do not fundamentally change the job but they do come with an increase in responsibilities, opportunities to learn and of course with more earning potential. - Although not on par with the traditionally high-earning jobs in consulting or banking, you can make a really good amount of money in OTE. - A good opportunity to learn vital soft skills. If you're keen to learn, you'll quickly pick up proficiency in negotiating, project management, client relationship management, and also gain confidence in speaking, both on the phone and in person. \u00a0- Upper and mid-level management are approachable and do care about feedback. You can genuinely walk up to very senior members of staff and have a chat about the company, share feedback, etc. Implementing the feedback is a bit more complicated as this is now a 600-strong company rather than a startup, but the atmosphere of openness with most managers is a breath of fresh air. - Great office, complimentary socials. Cons - A large amount of the work is very dull, especially if you have just come from an interesting course at a strong university (which 90% of colleagues will have). For project managers, the job is divided into two broad parts - recruiting experts to add them to Third Bridge's expert network, and sharing profiles of both new and existing experts with clients, in order to organise calls between the client and the expert. And that's it. You don't participate in the calls, and therefore learn very little about the projects themselves. This is exacerbated by the fact that, depending on the vertical, projects can be very, very short-term (sometimes literally hours), which means you will inevitably have to spend less time learning about the project focus and more time making sure you send\/recruit as experts as possible. For Research Analysts (the position you will most likely join Third Bridge as), you don't even do the client relationship part. This means that, 8 hours a day, you will be essentially doing recruitment, reaching out and cold messaging\/calling experts. The good news is that, if you manage to hit your target three months in a row, you will immediately be promoted to Project Manager. The bad news is that no target, no promotion - and most people do not make it more than 5-6 months at Research Analyst level without bailing if they are not promoted. - The target system: if you do not enjoy working in a target-driven environment where 20-25% of your effective salary (and up to 50% at more senior research positions) depends on your hitting your \"Triangulator target\", you should honestly not work here (at least in Connections - Forum and Intelligence are a different story). Target is the single most important aspect of working at Third Bridge and is what most people talk about when discussing work. - In line with the above point, if you don't enjoy the \"pressure to sell\" (in this case, to either push your client to organise calls or to chase prospective experts to join the network), this is not the job for you. If you cannot see yourself enjoying, or at least tolerating, large amounts of cold calling\/messaging, or if you think this skill is not worth learning for you, again, you should seriously reconsider working here. You will spend a good 50% of your time at work on the phone. This is not for everyone. - The downside to working at a company filled with young, smart and ambitious people is that gossip is rife at Third Bridge. 95% of it is harmless, but there are bad apples at the company who will take it too far, and unfortunately, if they are strong performers or senior, well-liked members of a team, there is little chance that they will face disciplinary action. - Although this has also changed in the past few months, you have very little say in which vertical\/team you will end up in. For context, the Connections business is divided into teams working for either Consulting Firms, PE Firms or Hedge Funds. Your experience will vary drastically depending on which vertical or which team you are put on. - Currently the compensation package is too weighted towards OTE and not base pay. This means that many employees' life is strongly affected by whether they hit target month-on-month (this often depends more on events outside of their control, rather than their individual performance). \u00a0- Long hours: if you want to succeed, it is almost impossible to do so while sticking to the 9-6 hours. Advice to Management - Explain the role more clearly in order to avoid recruiting people who leave after less than 6 months, as these are the cases that most harm morale. - Re-work the compensation package to make it less weighted towards target performance, and so that it is more in line with competitors in the market.","title":"Great first job straight out of uni - stay away if you don't like target-driven environments","prediction":"customer"},{"advice":"Standardise procedures, especially with regard to feedback, progression and HR","cons":"Negatives: leadership, opaque decision making, boring work, micromanagement","pros":"Summary:","rating":3,"text":"Pros Summary: Acceptable first job, especially if you're interested in a commercial\/business career. It will make you work fast and efficiently, at the cost of engagement with the actual research and independence. Superficial and repetitive, work at Third Bridge does not in itself motivate. Instead the company relies on bonuses, the prospect of promotion, and the threat of bad feedback as incentives, largely ignoring the supposed values. Positives: atmosphere, experience, money As mentioned in many reviews, Third Bridge has a nice, international atmosphere, due to the large number of bright, likeminded graduates the firm hires. This is a big factor, as you will work with plenty of people you will enjoy hang out with. There are also some perks like snacks\/drinks on Friday and socials. As a first job out of uni, its a good place to gain office experience as well as a crash course in business language and industry knowledge. The fast paced nature of the job pushes people to learn to organise their time very well. There is also an aspect of client relationship management, which is good experience. This is helpful for later job interviews. Bonuses are available for good performance, which means you can make quite good money. Third Bridge also promotes people relatively quickly, which in theory creates the potential for gaining leadership experience early. Cons Negatives: leadership, opaque decision making, boring work, micromanagement The word research is misleading, recruitment describes it better. Engagement with content is minimal, there are strong disincentives to actually learning about the topics, because it costs valuable time. Workload is consistently high and together with the target system generates strong incentives to work overtime. This is not compulsory and a minority of people does manage to leave on time consistently. Giving responsibilities to young people can lead to people managing others who have very little experience and not in every case obvious talent for this. Therefore new hires have very different experiences as some managers prioritise short term results over long term development and treat people they like of the same rank widely differently. This is especially true when somebody does not hit their targets, which will be blamed on the individual, regardless of external factors such as the amount of work coming in. The inconsistent treatment applies to other aspects as well, for example leaving the company. Ineffective middle\/upper management has in the past failed to address issues of leadership and above average pressure on individuals or teams. The numbers based target system as well as frequent feedback are supposed to ensure transparency and commons standards, but are applied inconsistently. In fact, I often felt as if transparency stops with management: Decisions are taken in closed meeting with most employees being told afterwards or find out when information slowly leaks through the company. In addition to the individual management issues outlined above, there is a general tendency in Third Bridge to micromanage processes in order to maximise narrow, company specific measures of efficiency. Competent employees have been told when and how to communicate dozens of times a day, making them perform worse. Despite a supposed culture of openness and developing people, feedback on the way the firm is run does not seem to be implemented beyond cosmetic measures. You will hear a lot about the values, but I did not feel they were central to the way Third Bridge works. Advice to Management Standardise procedures, especially with regard to feedback, progression and HR Focus on long term development instead of micromanaging individual behaviours Recognise factors beyond employees control and different circumstance more strongly Control low level and middle mangement better Communicate decisions clearly and timely","title":"Good people doing repetetive work under inconsistent management","prediction":"result"},{"advice":"- Get rid of (or at least change) the Triangulator, you try to force an objective system on an often subjective reality.

If you don't meet them for 3-4 months in a row (regardless of reason), your job is likely at risk. - Inexperienced middle-management: most managers up to Team Leader or even VP level have had Third Bridge as a first job and have simply worked their way up.

Revise HR practices: make exit procedure and expectations clear rather than having someone find out end of month that they haven't received their pay after quitting.
