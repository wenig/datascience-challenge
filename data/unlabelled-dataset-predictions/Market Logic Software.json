Management team leaves lots of fake reviews on Glassdoor and it's getting more obvious. The one posted January 2018 by a \"Senior Consultant, less than 1 year with the company\" there is no Senior Consultant who joined the company in the recent 2 years who is at all happy with the state of the company, much less think it produces a \"great product\". That review reeks of the language used by management. The 5 star posted December 2017 by a \"former Director\" and mentions how he\/she\/it likes the new office. The move happened October 2017, no Director left the company since moving to the new office. Also watch out for the fake salaries - management likes suppressing salaries and that includes dirty tactics like placing lower-than-average numbers or outright lies on review sites like Glassdoor. The recently posted \"Senior Go-To-Market Specialist: 39k-43k\" is a working example of this, there is no such position within the company!

Cons In the \u201cKick-start your career\u201d video on their website and in job offers, Market Logic Software advertise themselves as offering \u201cclose cooperation with experienced consultants\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive learnings from marketing\u201d in \u201can open multi-cultural environment\u201d. What a wet load of rubbish, really. As they made it look, I was very motivated to be part of a team with whom I could grow into the job, develop solid work relationships with everyday interaction \u2013team meetings, lots of contact with my workmates, etc.\u2013 and learn something valuable for my career. Instead, I was thrown into a big isolated room in a separate building with a herd of 30-40 students\/nobodies receiving instructions exclusively via email, Skype and Power Point to rewrite and copy-paste marketing info for a state-of-the-art software, with no training whatsoever. The area is called the \u201cService Factory\u201d, so you literally work in horrendous assembly-line fashion: I would check in, copy-paste and then check out without even seeing the result of my work as Market Logic Software never bothered to show it to me. Chances to grasp the job essentials and build solid work relationships were constantly escaping me, as I was just a floater across different business verticals, changing projects, teams, offices and buildings every two weeks, and thrown into the marketing intricacies of several industries\u2013from beverages, to pharma, pet food, candles, finances, etc.\u2013 with absolutely no training in between. The result: superficial work relationships; lack of understanding of the impact of your work; little to no sense of belonging; frustration and total lack of motivation, and inconsistent performances, frustrating for both the worker and the company. In summary, this is a digital, peripheral job with very, very poor professional or emotional reward. Also, as it's been similarly documented here on Glassdoor by former employees \u2013again, and again, and again, and again(!)\u2013 Market Logic Software has without a doubt one of the worst working atmospheres I have ever experienced in my 10-year career. The \u201cService Factory\u201d is a frosty, digital environment isolated from the other areas where due to the endless rotation every two weeks \u2013pet food, insurance, chocolates, pharmaceutics, rooms, buildings, desks, computers, projects, people, etc.\u2013 your so-called \u201cworkmates\u201d are all mutual strangers to each other like everyday commuters on the S-Bahn. I could easily spend a whole day at Market Logic without exchanging a \u201chello\u201d with anybody, and that included, obviously, those \u201cexperienced consultants\u201d that these vultures falsely advertise in their job adds and who communicate to students exclusively via Outlook and Skype. But perhaps the most awful aspect about this kitchen is that, instead of offering a proper training program, investing in an engaging working environment with more human interaction, and devising proper communication strategies to build corporate culture, HR restrict themselves to recruiting cheap kiddos from any discipline by the wholesale, offering them very little training, stretching and exploiting them to do everything, whilst assigning and supervising them exclusively by remote control \u2013Skype, Outlook, Excel, Power Point, and Google Drive. Revolting. The reality is that, since they trample lawyers, psychologists, sociologists, journalists, etc., into becoming marketing experts by miserably emailing them operative instructions on a Power Point, this pigsty is nowhere near interested in you to learn anything; in other words, they\u2019re nowhere interested in YOU whatsoever. They\u2019re just hungrily preying for Uni kiddos with English skills to use them as detachable, peripheral copy-pasters for their software whilst saving on costly training hours and skimping the firm a great deal of taxes through the reaps of the Werkstudent contract. Repulsive. Question is, why is it all like this? Well, the thing is, the HR Department is in reality not an HR Department. They are a bunch of Marketing predators who are there to exclusively stretch the company's budget through cheap, lumberjackish hiring, and to cost-efficiently and embarrassingly simulate Human Resources with just Skype, Outlook and Google Drive. This is a carefully conceived cost-efficient approach, typical within voracious, fast-growing companies at their young stage: saving costs, hiring the cheapest and maximising resources whilst excreting on their personnel. Appalling. In their gluttonous approach of acquiring \u201cyoung talent\u201d \u2013meaning \u201ccheap talent\u201d\u2013 by the dozen without investing a single penny on training or a healthy working environment, these predating Marketings \u2013disguised as \u201cHR department\u201d\u2013 whirl you into their already tired cannibal sequence: you are hired, castrated of your skills, then segregated, undertrained, assigned, reassigned, rotated, detached, reattached, jiggled with, tinkered with and turned inside out at their will, everything by remote control \u2013Outlook, Excel and Google Drive. Still, in the \u201cKick-start your career\u201d video on the company's website, the HR fakes sell illusions by referring to their herd of digital, peripheral floaters who don\u2019t even speak to each other as \"the team\u201d (!) To look attractive to the young\/cheap student market, they even enact the \u201cclose cooperation\u201d claim in the same video by posing next to one of the students, when in reality they couldn\u2019t care less about the rotating, expendable minions that they aloofly, predatorily and cost-efficiently administer exclusively by remote control \u2013Skype, Outlook, Google Drive. And this pigsty dares to call such dung \u201cHuman Resources\u201d? Wow, they actually can be that cynic. On top of that, their frosty, distant \"manage by wire\u201d approach also includes warped tactics like secretly monitoring employees, which according to the EU Employee Monitoring Law, is illegal. Anyone who has never been notified of the monitoring \u2013as the law demands\u2013 can rightfully ask questions to these fake vultures and lawfully protect their right to privacy \u2013just Google \u201cEU Employee Monitoring Law\u201d, it\u2019s all there in every link. So, \u201cclose cooperation with experienced consultants and comprehensive learnings from marketing in an open multi-cultural environment\u201d? Please cut the wet load of fake drivel, really. Market Logic are building a solid reputation for hiring by the wholesale English-speaking kiddos from whatever discipline, \u201ctraining them\u201d with Power Point and trampling results out of them whilst keeping them \u201cmotivated\u201d with their appallingly mechanistic, Stasi-inspired environment coldly administered by remote control. After 2 years, I can only say that this pigpen offers absolutely no professional or emotional reward to any decent professional, and my advise to potential candidates is, ignore the fake, too-positive reviews that these warped, hungry vultures post here on Glassdoor, and just look for a way better job opportunity elsewhere.

Firstly I write some truth about working student life because I was one before and there is over representation of positive student reviews on here. The turnover\/dissatisfaction among working students (research analysts) is high because of the repetitive and boring job. Research analyst is a fancy name for human robots for background data entry. They never see or use the actual software sold to clients. Many stay because the good pay and prospect of having a software company on their CV.

The company is German but employees constantly try too hard to be \"American\" with fake niceness and small talk.

I was subjected to incompetent project managers that did not train nor communicate with me efficiently. The human resources is disorganised and corrupt to be honest, they promote new people faster than others that have been there for three or more years. The working students are placed in another building and isolated from project team, only using Skype or email to communicate amongst each other. That is not how a market research company should be run. This company has too much money but no clue as to how to use it on anything but the slow and lagging internet. This work environment is unprofessional, what kind of work place has project managers and higher up staff lash out at employees that make mistakes, but drink beer on the job while watching a Eurocup match in the meeting room?
