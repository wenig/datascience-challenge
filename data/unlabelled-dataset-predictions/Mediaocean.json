Wants to be loved by all. Will ask you questions and has an open door policy but never listen to the answers. He just starts talking about himself. Man, he loves to talk about himself. He hires his pals for all of the open C- level positions. The people he keeps closest are the ones who yes him to death and make him feel special. One of the \"leaders\" he brought in a few years ago constantly says \"when I knew Bill at Yahoo\" so often that we're all like \"yes yes we know... thanks for telling us, again\". There is no growth here. Very few people actually move up. Sometimes the wrong ones do, but that happens everywhere. For new people leaving reviews saying there's growth opportunities, that's because there has been massive layoff, many rounds. So there is room when that happens but otherwise many people have been in the exact same roles for years. 5,10,15 etc without a promotion. Mediaocean was 2 competitors that merged with 2 very different cultures. Much has been replaced or more like, the culture really met in the middle. But there are people from both sides that hate the other and REFUSE to change the way they do anything. They re-org their internal structure so often, about 3 or 4 times times a year. Re-assigning teams and roles. They have a few team leaders who everyone HATES, the clients, and the MO personnel working for them. But for some reason keep those lazy, no good, do nothing, pass everything off, client ignoring account directors or SADs in place. They also blame EVERYTHING on Vista (the equity company that purchased them). You want to work from home? No you can't, Vista - a few months later, it was stated it really just depends on your manager. Vista is always their first response for motivation. Then after a change doesn't go over well the story changes. Advice to Management None, as they don't want hear it.

Since the acquisition there is a lot of confusion on who does what and a lot of procedural changes. This should work itself out over time. This isn't the first major change this company has gone through since we are still only a few years removed from the merge. The Pune office is a big con. I'm not sure if they undergo the same training as the rest of the company but they routinely seem out of the loop and unsure of how our products are actually being used. This is a big gap and not one I think will be fixed. Advice to Management Take a serious look at what works and what doesn't. Every year support hits their goals and makes the rest of the company look good. Other departments should follow that lead. It's possible to hit your personal bottom line and push the company forward in a satisfying and productive way, but it is not possible without strong leadership. If you don't have the guts to live up to your title, you don't deserve it. Everyone is depending on their leaders to get them through this time of change and uncertainty and achieve success.
