As of right now, we aren't as diverse a group as I would like. Fortunately, this is an issue that we are in agreement on as a team and I feel that there is a sincere effort to move in the right direction while Cedar is still small.","pros":"I'm one of the more senior people on the engineering team. I am super happy to be at Cedar. The technical team is very sharp, the problems that we are working on are interesting, and the product is having a real, positive impact on both our customers (the health care providers) and the patients that they serve.","rating":5,"text":"Pros I'm one of the more senior people on the engineering team. I am super happy to be at Cedar. The technical team is very sharp, the problems that we are working on are interesting, and the product is having a real, positive impact on both our customers (the health care providers) and the patients that they serve. Specifics: * Tech leadership is very thoughtful and committed to long-term success of team members as well as the company. I think there's a real understanding that burning out your team members burns out your company. The focus is on being productive and collaborative, not on seeing who can stay longest in the office at night. * Very open and collegial atmosphere in the office. No politics, no cliques, no secrets. * Junior hires are supported with mentorship and career development * There's an openness to new technology without the compulsive drive to chase it. Our stack in early 2018 is Python 3 + Django + PostgreSQL on the backend and React + Redux + RxJs on the front, which provides a really solid foundation with room to explore. * A real commitment to being introspective as a team about processes, organization, and technology. We talk about what works and doesn't work in our team structure and are empowered to make changes that we decide on as a team. * Company is set up for success. There's a deep sales funnel, good product-market fit, great leadership, and substantial capital resources. There is nothing certain in the world of startups, but I like Cedar's chances. This won't always be true, but as of now no one has ever left Cedar. I think that speaks volumes about what it's like to work here.
