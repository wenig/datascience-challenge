Although it took a while, they have a season ticket loan service now as well, which was one that seemed conspicuous in its absence. The facilities are pretty great, especially the new 1st floor leisure area and meeting space which has been really well kitted out! The business has a pretty relaxed take on your working day, and it's full of different social groups who participate in loads of different activities and hobbies together - board games, video games etc. The business and line managers are very supportive of those who wish to occupy their downtime with learning, many people within the business start off in a different role to where they are a few years later (QA to Developer in Test to Developer is a common path). If you're a technophile, or a gadget nut, you'll be surrounded by like-minded individuals. Cons Promotion prospects can vary pretty wildly depending on which part of the business you do the bulk of your work in, with some teams seeing frequent promotions and others not so much. Politics can creep into this aspect as well, with some people getting bad reputations because someone higher up doesn't like them as much as others. There has been a history of promoting the people who say the right things, rather than the ones who necessarily do the best job, but that seems to be getting better. Historically, I haven't always felt that I got useful feedback in terms of areas to address in order to progress. Unsure as to whether that's because there was no feedback to give (and I was being kept back for some political reason) or whether they were unsure how to resolve the issues. Again, this has improved over time. The office does have a bit of politicking, but I imagine that's pretty common and that Gamesys isn't atypical. Advice to Management Keep communications open - Nobody wants to be bothered by everyone from every team about every little thing all the time, but at the same time just having one point of contact within a team means that you don't always get a clear understanding of more than one point of view. Keep promoting people who want to make changes for the better, and not just those who tell you what you want to hear! An analogy which feels appropriate: If person 1 is saying person 2 is difficult, and persons 3-10 are saying they find person 1 impossible, maybe don't be too hasty to judge person 2 too harshly.","title":"Not without its problems, but a fun place full of great people!","prediction":"detail"},{"advice":"Improvement Middle and Senior management, most have been promoted from development background but have not management training.","cons":"Company has grown quickly and processes and structure has not adapted.","pros":"Great environment, with many social activities, always busy and challenging","rating":5,"text":"Pros Great environment, with many social activities, always busy and challenging Cons Company has grown quickly and processes and structure has not adapted.

Startup vs Enterprise: If you've got some great ideas yourself about using this or that framework, dont expect a speedy transition even if you're \"correct\" - in fairness they've been burnt a lot of times by new tech going wrong, or not having the right levels of knowledge to run it, and are wary of new tech and new ideas, but it is possible to progress at a snails pace. For example, they've only just adoped git over svn which is a nobrainer, but has taken them to now to do it. The slowness is probably by design- helping with their stability as a platform which must not go wrong at all costs, and the fact they have hundreds upon hundreds of members of staff, and so quickly steering all those staff is nigh on impossible... but if you're someone keen to implement something you know which has a great benefit , your overriding feeling with be one of frustration and you have to be patient to the tune of years. The best I've seen is you may get lucky and might get asked to prove your idea and the benefits... they aren't averse to good ideas. Gamesys love spending money on enterprise products when they have some great talent who could easily engineer their own solutions with open source tools available.

Middle management seem competent.","rating":1,"text":"Pros Some of the people who work here are very talented. The salary is not bad. Middle management seem competent. Cons Seriously, anyone thinking of going here should read all the reports here about bullying and take them seriously. I'm still and employee here, but I'm looking to change that as soon as I can. Working here has been one of the most unpleasant experiences of my life. I\u2019d like to reiterate several of the points others have made here. If you work here at some point you will most likely find yourself being bullied. I have witness staff being given an extremely vocal dressing down in the middle of the office with everyone watching. It is not what you do here that counts, but how loudly you shout. There are some really useless people who talk a really good talk and are extolled as examples to the rest of us. There is a clique of people who have been here for years and that inner circle is impossible to gain access to no matter how hard you work or how good you are at your job. What the recruitment consultants sell to you about this company is very different from the reality of it. Instead of listening to what your recruiter is saying read the negative reviews here and ask yourself how so many people can be saying similar things. I cannot stress what a miserable time I have had here. If I had read the reviews on this site before accepting the job offer I would not have come here. Do yourself a favour and look elsewhere. No amount of money is worth what you\u2019ll go through here Advice to Management Stop strutting around the place like a bunch of wannabe alpha males and start to treat your staff with some respect.","title":"Best avoided if you want to retain your sanity.","prediction":"customer"},{"advice":"Please communicate more broadly.","cons":"Too many priorities being worked on at the same time.

The projects and workload, while exciting and appealing, can be very demanding and a lot of the teams are expected to drop their personal lives at a moment's notice, to work late or work weekends which is unacceptable for no thanks. One of the biggest issues was the \"drive-by\" mentality from senior managers in the late stages of a game development process which resulted in the fact that the project was thrown for 6. This meant longer hours to change fundamental parts of a game that frankly, didn't need to be changed. Agile methods were executed differently by each team and a lot of dependencies from cross-team requirements meant that often a game or launch was impeded. One of the most crazy things I saw was Marketing not bothering to talk to Studio. They'd book expensive TV slots and not align to any of the sprints for delivery, often not telling anyone in the teams when a new game or service was needed and not really allowing for the work to be done - resulting again, in stressed teams running around to fix the problem. If you want to work for a company that pushes you hard, expects you to sweat blood and tears and fails to even thank you at the end of it (apart from a 360 process that doesn't use any objectives properly) - then this organisation is for you.

Cons This company it is not what it seems, the recruiters, managers and technical people try to sell you something that doesn't exist. After my first month there, I realised the terrible mistake I had committed. For starters the technical stack it's obsolete, for instance the main database is DB2. The architecture is monolithic and the projects are old and a big mess and the releases last forever. There are a couple of new projects, but beware you won't work on them. The company plays favourites all the time and if you are a new starter you would be assigned to one of the old projects and then pray to be reassigned - unlikely to happen. Team wise, it's quite average and playing politics all the time, so be careful what you say and do. Some are friendly, but they are just playing you. Then depends on the team, if you are under a certain TA you are assured to have a hard time. In my time there so many people left that team because of his ways, but managers choose to do nothing - apparently he is one of the favourites. I was lucky in that sense, the TA was a bit better. But still, everything was \"do this\" and \"with these tools\" and that's all the help and freedom you'd get. There is no freedom to select any technology out of the stack, except for a few individuals and then they can sell that to management - for instance Neo4j. Career wise, well, nothing unless you are one of the favourites. The reviews are based on your popularity, visibility and on the project you are working on.
