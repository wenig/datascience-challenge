(This also happened with many other people I worked with- we all ended up leaving MUCH better paying jobs based on these false expectations) We were taught all these 'amazing' things about the products I sold but, after talking with real users in the market place, seeing competitors' products, and trying to demo our products, I realized they are some of the worst and are in no way competitive (in quality or price). I personally came in with a lot of experience but they offer no support or real training. Because of this, I saw many colleagues who came in with less experience struggle and fail miserably as they tried to figure things out on their own. The overall morals that are held and encouraged by management are atrocious. You are fully expected to try to pull the wool over clients' eyes to make any sell and are supported if you get caught stealing deals from colleagues. The two things I heard most often were \"Ask for forgiveness, not for permission,\" and \"I don't have morals when it comes to business.\" I see no strength in the company itself- they constantly just buy up-and-coming start-ups, sell said start-ups products without improving or growing said start-up's products, until these products are no longer competitive and eventually die. They believe they will be successful completely based on the notion of \"It will sell because we're NASDAQ,\" albeit my previous statement and the fact that NASDAQ is only really known in the listings market. Advice to Management Create a better internal culture. Hold people accountable for not just numbers but for the rules set forth by the company.

Each year titles are renamed, groups are volleyed back and forth between senior managers in the name of \"growth\" \"efficiency\" \"synergy\" This leads to an unfortunate loss of direction each time a reorganization\/management shift occurs in the technology organization. Despite these shifts, the groups and the organizational process\/workflow\/structure have remained relatively unchanged. The same groups talk to each other to get the same work accomplished. Rather than the Greens talking to the Yellows, it simply shifts to the Oranges talking to the Browns in title only. It is very similar to the observation that mergers fail due to organizational processes not meshing together. - A technology company severely incapacitated by the recent corporate culture of defendable decisions since the technology issues of the largest IPO. e.g. \"No one ever got fired for hiring IBM.\" This has mainly led to the culture comprised of skilled, agile teams, capable of building solutions, to incapable teams that have lost their top talent to turnover. The policies put forth make for a severely demoralizing & demotivating a workforce that's otherwise tremendously capable. This makes for a fairly oppressive work environment and a structure that engenders mistrust. A small bit of sanity comes from the small alliances that are forged amongst the Romeos & Juliets of groups at odds with each other. - Senior management is severely disconnected from the ground floor workers as they are incapable of dog-fooding the products & policies they put forth. As many know, an idea does not sell itself, but the hard work and attention to detail make the difference. By pushing policies in the name of leaving a legacy, resume bullet point, or being a yes-man, relationships & respect are broken. - ADHD inducing distractions. Being an open setup, there's a tremendous lack of ability to focus on a task at hand. Advice to Management Bob G asks at group lunches, \"What can we do to improve our company?\" When most of the employees are speechless, it's not that there aren't any improvements to make, it's that they are paralyzed from speaking as they don't know where to begin. - Our salaries reflect that we are a knowledge workforce rather than a labor workforce. The most important competitive advantage of a knowledge workforce is the cultivation and management of that knowledge & critical thinking base. Top talented engineers make great team leads, however are very unlikely to be good managers. - Stop reorganizing the company. History has shown that war has not been a struggle over territory as much as the battle for a shift in power. As different heads continue to battle for territory, it's a reflection of individuals shifting their priorities from EXCELLENCE to SELF-PRESERVATION. As management's focus shifts to self-preservation, competitive edge is lost as top talent decides that their sanity is more important than the compensation package. - Focus on building & forging employee relationships rather than relying on top-down edicts of how employees should work. Build a collaborative environment where minds can mesh. Google about the design of the Bell Labs Hallway. When it comes to fixing problems, there are 2 types of consultants. Ones that are looking to bill you for putting on a show, and ones that understand that the individuals best suited to fixing an organization are the individuals within it. The latter consultant merely facilitates the process of finding the individuals capable of a finding a fix and facilitating that fix. - Invest in infrastructure and building environments capable of being tested during work hours rather than during the weekends. A burned out employee is incapable of contributing to the knowledge base of the organization as a whole.","title":"Opportunities within the framework of defendable decisions","prediction":"result"},{"advice":null,"cons":"Lots of turnover in the employee base as well as constant change.","pros":"Ability to make a lot of money.","rating":5,"text":"Pros Ability to make a lot of money.

I've even gotten the notion on some calls that one line will intentionally not release a product even if it's a good idea and has a solid business case just because they don't want to deal with the other. In my opinion, one solution to this problem would be to merge the groups. The marketing group also may need to be decentralized but controlled by a small group to ensure that the efforts from each product line adhere to branding starndards and a unified marketing message. What's going on now is that it's so locked down and centralized that it's almost impossible to get a both accurate and creative market message out regarding a new product. The marketing area should also be responsible for the analysis of the statistical data generated from the marketing vehicles that are being used. There is pretty much no standardization of the way market collects this data across the marketing vehicles to judge things like response rates to certain types of advertising, visits and user data from the various websites (and there are many). Again, this is only my opinion, but there doesn't seem to be a solid handle on all of the market data points coming into the company from all of the marketing venues. This is severely hindering the cross sellability of all exisiting gproducts as well as the impact of getting new customers roped in. There is also a lot of money being spent by the marketing team to outsource the creation of a lot of the verious ad materials and not enough time spent talking to the customers\/business lines\/technology side to get a handle on what the product actually sells to the customer so an effective marketing piece can be created. This area needs to be revamped. Technology is also a little dicey, but not nearly as bad as it could be. It's biggest threat is (and probably always will be) that there is a culture of \"my way is the right way\" and it centers around job security. If there was a reward system in place for rewarding innovation rather than empire building, that may help. Also, there is a clear tactic that seems to have gotten a lot of traction (right before I left anyway) which was used by some senior managers on the technology side This tactic would be to create a crisis and then solve it in order to remain visible. It seems that visibility is where the pot of gold lies for the management and staff. This leads to stress on the empployees (which could account for the low morale in some way and wasted money in the form of hours spent solving problems that are blown out of proportion. In my opinion, this type of crisis management can never lead to a smoothly running operation where innovation and actual capitalism can allow the business to grow.","title":"Some bugs to work out, but not all bad.","prediction":"detail"},{"advice":"People are an asset; value and develop them","cons":"No corporate culture, low morale, poor senior management, no respect for individuals","pros":"potential for stock option appreciation from ruthless and greedy management","rating":1,"text":"Pros potential for stock option appreciation from ruthless and greedy management Cons No corporate culture, low morale, poor senior management, no respect for individuals Advice to Management People are an asset; value and develop them","title":"NASDAQ: morally bankrupt","prediction":"customer"},{"advice":"Motivation is very important and every employee is worth fighting for.","cons":"It is hard to upgrade knowledge.

It makes it hard to see a long term future at NASDAQ. Your career 'path' here is more like a career 'step'.

There's a lot of finger pointing when things go wrong when the process all together can often be a circus act. Documentation is seriously lacking. Most people retain information and as soon as they leave, that information goes with them.

Huge turnover rate of anyone with skill. Very political promotion structure. Management doesn't do well with struggling employees, people severely underperforming seem to not be correctly dealt with. As another review states once you get a job you're most likely to keep it which is great for those who want job security, but it means the people you're working with aren't scared of bad performance and due to the poor promotional procedures they won't bother to work on it. It causes a lot of averagely made ad-hoc solutions as no-one is willing to take the extra step to fix processes and issues. Say they pay for performance yet pay rises are like getting blood from a stone. General consensus internally is that compensation is low despite the workloads and the somewhat false reputation that NASDAQ pays well. Pay rises come few and far between so ensure your start pay is high enough to start with.
