Most of the clients are not marketing-first businesses, which gives strategy and product teams lots of room to shine, though it sometimes leaves creative teams frustrated. New HR initiatives (in NY office, at least) are starting to help address some transparency and benefits problems, issues that probably contributed to employees on-the-fence deciding to accept other offers. Office was recently renovated and has a bright, open design. Unless you live uptown, you'll prefer Soho \/ Hudson square to midtown, both for the neighborhood's vibe and the lunch options. Cons Senior leadership is generally smart and trust-worthy, but is kind of a boys club that you're most likely to break into by speaking loudest (literally) and getting yourself invited to happy hour whiskeys often. All-agency meetings can feel like pep rallies, and when they include news of losing business, there's a drink-the-kool-aid feel to them. This hurts morale, rather than strengthening it. You're not advertising here, you're speaking to employees. Positive spin shouldn't be part of that. Employee reviews have lacked structure\/timetable, and compensation is lower than NY industry average. A brand new review process hopefully solves the first problem, but who knows about the second. Advice to Management Continue success\/emphasis on hiring the best, most motivated candidates. Keep up increased effort on new business. 2016 was tough, but our grit is already paying off in 2017 with new wins. But remember your employees like leaders because of their hard work and honesty, not their self fashioned celebrity\/hero status around the office. Your experience is much different than ours, and our day-to-day satisfaction is first and foremost based on our team's leaders and dynamic.
