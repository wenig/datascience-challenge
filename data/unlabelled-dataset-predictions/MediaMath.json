Documentation is lacking when on boarding. You are just kind of on your own if your team is not lucky enough to have someone who's been working at MediaMath for a few years. For what MediaMath offers we need to come up with structured on boarding and education for each and every employee. Each employee should feel empowered to provide value to the company. Its very hard to do this if you employees do not even fully understand the business which is crucial in MediaMath's business. On the Frontend side of things people are encouraged to work in silos but still on a single app. Decisions can feel like they are top down. However, we've been working to find ways to make decisions a conversation rather than a top down approach. I'd like to be more connected to the various teams which can be difficult when people are spread across so many offices. Advice to Management We need a real and structured program to make sure every MediaMath employee that comes through the door understands the business. I think a 2-4 week on-boarding program where new hires focus on learning the MediaMath business in a classroom like setting is probably in the company's best interest in the long run. One off classes every other week for an hour over the phone just does not help people to really know the business and understand it in a way that allows them to push it forward. As it stands right now on-boarding takes longer than it has to IMO as a result of a lack of structure as it relates to people understanding the business. One other thing is we could do a better job with changing technology and trends. Changes will happen. We need to have a way to make changes if we need to in the future and without having to overhaul the whole app. The UI for our app needs a complete overhaul IMO from the UX to the design to the code. Overall though, Mike, Steve and Joe and the rest of the MediaMath team are really really smart people and likable people.","title":"The best Frontend engineers I've worked with easily","prediction":"collaboration"},{"advice":"Maybe employees could use a little more direction at times instead of being left to their own devices, but then again...

MediaMath does a great job in hiring smart and driven people, and if you end up working for a solid manager who's interested in helping you grow, you're life here will be productive in your own development. Cons While MediaMath does a good job hiring talent, they don't help themselves at all on retention. It only takes about 12 months for solid performers to see what's it's like and either resign themselves to staying in their role long enough to avoid questions in future job interviews, or start looking immediately for their next step. Leadership here is quite poor. Over a two year period, the company completely switched departmental priorities multiple times based on the latest \"opportunity\" in the market without adhering to a long term vision and without properly resourcing against current commitments. This is a culture of \"no\" internally, but \"yes\" to everything under the sun externally. This is the place to work if you're willing to sit at your desk and do a limited role, and aren't easily bothered by meetings and inefficiency. If you have suggestions on how to improve processes, expect to fight hard and get nowhere. On culture, it's only as deep as your manager. In the Cambridge office, the engineering team lacks leadership of any kind, and the attrition over the last 12 months is evidence of that. The engineering lead for the last two years is openly disrespectful of his own team and his product peers, and has loudly yelled at and berated others in the office with no repercussions. Amazingly, he's still employed though no one on our engineering team can explain what he does. If you're hurting for a job, sure, jump on board here until you find your next step. Otherwise, keep looking. C-level leaders are much more focused on getting acquired for a price that begins with a 'b' than making a quality product and aligning resources to serve market needs (reportedly turned down an acquisition offer for $900M). Advice to Management Commit yourselves to understanding what leadership really means. It includes humility, an ability to listen, and the competence to provide a practical vision that you can commit to. Also, and it's amazing that this even needs to be said, ripping into your direct reports in public meetings doesn't make up for a lack of competence. This is especially true of product leadership at the most senior level.","title":"Whiplash, frustration, and big egos in senior leadership","prediction":"collaboration"},{"advice":"Focus on operating at scale and stay nimble while doing so.","cons":"Navigating a complex sector, so priorities can change quickly.","pros":"Leader and innovator in exciting growth sector.

Sales and account managers are a dime a dozen and it doesn't take a rocket scientist. They also spend more money on frivolous client dinners, happy hours and ridiculous amounts of travel that don't amount to more revenue. For most new people coming in there is almost no training or on-boarding because people are leaving by the masses. There are also no raises or promotions for employees who have worked hard and deserve it, only for those who are willing to suck up to whoever will listen and spend hours stroking managements egos telling them how wonderful and smart they are. If you're an employee at MediaMath and have been at the company for 2 years or more you can forget it you're probably not going to get that raise and promotion you were promised. You'll be better off going somewhere that will actually pay you what you're worth. The HR department (or what's left of them) is pretty incompetent for the most part and don't actually have any power to change or do anything because no one seems to trust them. They did hire a new CPO finally so hopefully she'll be able to make some changes but that's doubtful considering there's never been strong leadership in that department. Overall it's really sad what happened to a once fun and happy place to work but management only has themselves to blame. Advice to Management Listen to your employees, provide better training for new employees and especially management. Get rid of the management and executives who are dead weight, and go back to focusing on building a stronger Product. Set goals and stick to them instead of changing directions every 6 months. You'll never accomplish anything that way and it sends a message that it doesn't matter how hard you work because in 6 months all that work won't matter anyways!","title":"Burning ring of fire","prediction":"result"},{"advice":"- SET your teams and employees up for success.
