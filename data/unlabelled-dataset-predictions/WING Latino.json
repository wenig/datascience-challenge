There's an attempt to evolve the agency but completely misses the mark that a diverse hire in Grey will ultimately deem this unit obsolete in a few years. Regardless, there's a lack of contemporary relevancy in culture and the new media landscape. Their lack of agility will eventually make them irrelevant. Very few accounts are WING's, making this business unit close to a translation house. There's no business development team nor a strategy to approach clients outside of Grey and identify better clients. Partially, because of the lack of company vision. The supposed important taste are insipid and the few good creative output are driven by the younger folks have a personal commitment to have great work in addition to drive business revenue. Barely see folks challenge the work and make it better. Only a few people do, most don't. The leading air is also very traditional across departments. Media, strategy and creativity is seen in silos, and as if the only output is a TVC. Tons of the employees seem to all be from the same traditional Latino agency deterring diversity and encouraging a few cliques. WING also has not shown interest in grooming and training their employees to inject effective and efficient agency process. They've also hired a few under qualified employees. Don't expect to learn much on the strategy front. Expectation among employees is also disheartening, there was a moment when the entire Wing team was told in an agency meeting to see if we can find doctors who can see their patients after or early at work. The entire agency was told that if they were working late and on weekends, they were being inefficient versus acknowledging that they are understaffed. The desire for control over employees is very blatant. Have also embarrassed a few employees publicly. Really understaffed and tons of underqualified folks. Hope someone is enjoying their bonuses.

There's a sense of family and camaraderie among a few employees. They are part of Grey and WPP, providing an opportunity to use their resources. From a few training classes at Grey to access with multiple research and creative tools and see how you can synthesize information using Grey's proprietary tools. You'll be able to tap a few smart minds on the Grey side. Majority of WING's business comes from Grey, it's almost automatic that the Grey team recommends their translation and Hispanic work to Wing. So it's stable in that regards. Amazing office, amazing office location too. In front of the Flatiron building, above Eataly and across Madison square park. You'll have lots of food options. Ok benefits and ok company activities.","rating":3,"text":"Pros You'll meet a few hardworking, talented and kind human beings. There's a sense of family and camaraderie among a few employees.
