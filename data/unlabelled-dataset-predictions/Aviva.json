Whilst a lot of the IT systems are still very much outdated on the front-end, there has been a lot of investment in the few years I have been away to create modern interface tools to simplify the end-user experience. Overall the systems are now about as easy to use as other insurers I have worked with. There is a lot of flexibility in certain business areas to choose a full-time working pattern that fits with personal\/family commitments. Whilst you can still work 9-5 if you choose, you can for instance, choose a pattern of 3 x 12 hour shifts per week, leaving 4 days off. This is pure gold for people with families and seems to be very popular. There is a big emphasis now on customer experience. Every member of staff has equality of opinion as far as systems and processes go.

It was initially difficult to make the choice to apply for a role and come back. The redundancies of 2013 of which I was a part of was not pleasant at the time. But time certainly changes one's perspective and I am glad I have come back. The whole company seems much more positive and forward thinking now, and this is translating into excellent performance results. My advice to management is do not forget the journey we have been through in the last 5 years. Remember what has now made us the top choice for life and general insurance and keep up the forward momentum we have at present.","title":"Returning Employee.

Cons Had an odd experience during a job interview for an Account Receivable\/Junior Accountant. I had a rough estimate of the size of receivables portfolio I worked with. These days job applicants are encouraged to include $ numbers because the accountants like numbers and can get a feel quantitatively the volume of work and level of responsibility the applicant had in their last role. I even saw the same advice on LinkedIn recently. My former supervisor was okay with what was on my resume and reviewed it in preparation to be my employment reference. Further my former employer is a public company and publishes its financial statements online for all to see. I got repeatedly scolded up by one of the 5 interviewers for including $ numbers on my resume and the others remained passive. He was repeating the same sentence over and over something to the effect: \"You put numbers on your resume\". I can't tell you what I really thought about him but I can say that he didn't appear to have a straight head. The 5 staff who interviewed me seemed like clerical staff and weren't particularly insightful or they didn't have HR\/recruitment skills.
