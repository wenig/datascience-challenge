We have a great group of officers who are willing to help one another out. The schedule and pay is based off of the site that you are going to work for.

You will get out of the job whatever you are willing to put into the job. Benefits- If your single the benefits are not that expensive.

This is like that for most companies though. Very laid back Super Easy work If you are wanting to work OT, you will have every opportunity there is Cons Everything is contractual- Pay, Vacation, Sick time ETC OT Pay- If you pick up OT, you get paid the amount that the site you are going to pays. So if you make $13 at one site and go to a site that pays $10, then you will be making OT on the $10 pay rate instead of your normal site that pays $13. I think G4S needs to pay you your normal site pay. Vacation time and sick time are all in one bank. Also vacation and sick time does not build. You get one set amount after you have been with the company for a year. Once it is gone, it is gone. You have to wait another year to get more. Most places I am being told only give you 1 week for both sick and vacation time combined. No negotiation in pay when accepting a new position. You get what ever that site is paying the officers. This is regardless of your experience. If you have 10+ years experience and you start working with someone that has only 1 year of experience, you both make the same. Advice to Management G4S needs to have a standard accrual vacation package instead of just the one that the site you work at offers. You should reward your employees that are willing to give you longevity. Also, upper management needs to be seen more in the field in order to let your employees know that you care about them.
