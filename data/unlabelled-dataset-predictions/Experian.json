Cons EMS's best years are behind it. It's a business run by financial people who see every employee as a prospective money-saving cut to be made. It's best assets are certainly not its people, as they are expendable. The more you make, the more at risk you are. An example of this was last year's wholesale layoff of people in the NYC office, moving jobs to ill-prepared employees in Costa Rica making a fraction of what the New York employees made. The Costa Rican employees were unprepared, and Experian was forced to make offers to people they had previously laid off. Technology was ignored and not invested in for years, and so Cheetah started losing clients to competitors. With little in-house innovation talent, they were forced to buy a not-ready-for-primetime \"cross-channel\" platform that was panned by Forrester. The Cheetahmail\/Cross-Channel Marketing Marketing has not had a leader in a year. Most senior marketing and product development people have left, pushed out or fired over the past 6 months.

And of course, mass layoffs are routine. I worked there for almost 15 years, and for the first few years, the layoffs happened perhaps every three years, including the year I started. The last six years have incurred layoffs every year, with the rate increasing to quarterly this year. Perhaps this is due to the change in upper management to those with a background in finance: the bottom line for the next quarter is everything (shareholders must see an immediate profit!), and long-term planning is moot? I guess time will tell if this strategy works or if the talent pool of experienced workers becomes so drained that data quality becomes severely compromised.
