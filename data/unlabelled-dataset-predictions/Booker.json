It would appear that not all the reviewers are portraying a true booker experience. Working at Booker for years now, I can attribute much of my growth as a professional to the tutelage and guidance of company leaders and my peers here at Booker. We collaborate, we work together, and frankly we get stuff done. The passion for the Health, Wellness, and Beauty industry is remarkable and I can say that I have honestly never spoken to a client who I did not believe I could help become even more successful. The Scottsdale office is kind-of a leadership power house which I appreciate and is the growth hub for the company. You have good VP's from many different departments close by and always willing to discuss a project, idea, or innovation you may have. Tends to be a younger culture as a whole, that likes to have fun but also respects that people have families and lives, always trying to include everyone from all different walks in life. Pretty relaxed office environement, with your typical games (ping pong, ladder ball, basketball,) music, snacks etc... all those little extras that make waking up at 5:30 to beat the traffic worth it. They treat me well, respect my opinion, pay well for the Phoenix area, and offer great benefits so I have no complaints on all those fronts. Cons -No 401k match -Sometimes we get a little caught up in a goal or project and lose sight of the BIG picture of the value we provide for our clients. -Things move quickly here, which isn't for everyone.

This plays a part with every decision, whether it is good or bad, this is why it is so important to constructive and not destructive when bringing up topics. But This is all true at any organization.","pros":"Compensation\/Opportunities:","rating":5,"text":"Pros Compensation\/Opportunities: I started at Booker a little under 3 years ago as a junior software engineer and within 3 years I was able to get 3 separate promotions, almost doubling my compensation and I am happy to say that I am now a technical lead on a team of other really strong and great software engineers of all disciplines. Suffice to say Booker has given me and many others tremendous opportunity to jump start our careers. The engineering manager values his employees greatly and will often go above and beyond to ensure his employees are happy. I cannot stress that enough. Work Life Balance: Working more then you should is strongly discouraged within the company, you will seldom find people working after hours. If there are people in the office after hours its usually just to listen to music and hang out over a beer because the people that work at Booker are all incredibly talented, intelligent and like minded folk. Booker also provides lots of fun activities for employees on a regular basis, like our annual summer Olympics or the monthly trivia as well as many parties and events throughout the year. The Gems at Booker are the people who work there, and even past employees cannot deny that, as you will often see them attend Booker events just to be around all the great people who work here. On top of that management is really understanding about working from home and PTO. PTO is virtually endless as long as you do what is expected, and for things like bereavement, people have been really understanding and given me as many days as I needed from a personal tragedy. Many of the engineering staff work from home 3-4 days a week and as long as their work is being completed this is OK. We are more project based then time based. On top of all of this, the HR department is really approachable and great to work with. They are constantly improving and always send out surveys to get insight from everyone. They provide breakfast in the morning, snacks throughout the day and host the many events we have at Booker. Management: The current management in Product & Technology is focused on empowering their teams\/employees. We have moved away from the Top-Down management approach to a more Bottom-Up approach. We aren't held to some insurmountable and unattainable delivery date, but instead a delivery date that is more realistic and estimated by the individual teams. On top of this the technology department is invested heavily in moving the platform to the cloud. So the days of negotiating a time frame by compromises on the technology are over. We will take the time we need to ensure we do things the right way the first time, because this is overall better for the platform Day-To-Day: The actual work we have in the product and technology side is actually really cutting edge. As I stated above we are heavily invested into moving to the cloud but we have a lot of unique constraints that makes this very challenging. We are also making major strides in how we build independently releasable services and how these many services communicate with each other. On the server-side there is lots of work to do and its all cutting edge. On the client-side we have also heavily invested in the Ember.js framework and for good reason! Ember.js is designed for ambitious applications and we Booker is quite an ambitious project. On the day-to-day team side, we do have a 10 AM daily stand-up and follow Kanban-agile methodology for our processes. Final Word: When I first started at Booker we were in a transition phase and there were many ups and downs. We had some crummy managers in the past and we hit some rocky roads where some tough decisions needed to be made to keep the company going. This is part of any business, especially in the start-up world. That being said, through the many growing pains the company has gone through, 1 thing has been a constant, they have listened to their employees and made DRASTIC improvements. To name a few, they have hired some REALLY AMAZING middle management, they have renovated the main office 2 different times, they have better empowered their employees, and set up mechanisms for career growth and opportunity, and they have invested into technology to improve the platform. The result of all of this is a work environment that has drastically improved over the last 3 years. On top of all that the business has been pulling up some good numbers as of late and we are slated to become profitable fairly soon. This is all very good news and proves out all the hard work and changes the organization has made to be more streamlined and strategic in the improvements they've made to the organization. The truth is always in the numbers. Cons The biggest con I think that exists at Booker, but also exists at every organization is politics. This plays a part with every decision, whether it is good or bad, this is why it is so important to constructive and not destructive when bringing up topics. But This is all true at any organization. The other major con is they do not offer 401k matching, this is a major reason why i have not signed up for their in house 401k offering.

With any tech start up there are of course ups and downs in the sales department. I'm proud to say Booker Sales department shows a successful story where there are mostly ups and very few downs. To start, each rep has a ramping period gear to help each rep build a pipeline to reach and exceed their goals. During this ramping period, each rep has constant support and guidance from the management\/leadership team. The support and guidance includes daily team meetings with the sales director and weekly one on one meetings with the sales director. The sales director is truly one of the best that is out there in any Saas company . Started out as an associate making 100s of calls a day to becoming one of the leaders making a company go public. He is a great mentor for the fact that he knows exactly what each rep is going through with having a goal over their heads and being judge on performance since he was walking in your shoes not that long ago in his career. It being a sales job you have a quota that you have to reach each month. At Booker though that quota is something that with hard work and a positive attitude can be achieved month in and month out. All in all if you are someone considering looking into Booker for a sales career you are looking into the right place.

However, the health\/dental benefits are the best I have personally had at any job to date. Yes, there have been layoffs. I would estimate somewhere between 5 and 10 percent employee downsizing occurred in 2016. The company made some bad bets on expanding into markets that our product did not scale well for. This initiative has been abandoned for 2017 which shows me that senior management is aware and willing to adjust. Yes, there have been system issues, server stability primarily, that led to some very hard work days for the customer support staff. Booker has recently moved to a different third party server provider and those issues have been resolved since. The product itself is starting to appear dated and I'm sure that makes it hard to sell at times. I am not on the sales team but can identify with the negative reviews left by sales reps. The Booker Product Team has shown \"coming soon\" sneak peaks of redesigns in the works that I am hoping hit the market in 2017. Advice to Management Keep working hard.

Booker has two comfortable lunch areas, with games and cable TV, making for a pleasant break. Fruit, like bananas and apples, are delivered once a week. The office is centrally located near the Fulton station in downtown and has great views of the WTC and the Hudson river. Cons UNCOMPETITIVE COMPENSATION Uncompetitive compensation is the number one problem at Booker. When compared on Glassdoor to average salaries for similar positions at similar companies in the same area, Booker pays anywhere from 25-50% less. This discrepancy in pay even occurs within Booker between employees in the same or similar roles. Specific examples include an employee who took over the position of a leaving employee with the same title, responsibilities, and experience, but made $20,000 less (~30% less); an employee who had been promoted multiple times and had been in their current role for a year was earning about $45,000 less (~50% less) than what a new employee in the same role received; a person was hired at $25,000 less (~35% less) than the average for the role based on Glassdoor; people hired into the Customer Experience department make less than people hired into the same roles one or two years ago. For two years in a row, annual performance reviews have come with no opportunity of an increase in compensation. In 2014 for the 2013 year, many managers did not conduct reviews unless approached by their employees even though HR had a clear performance review policy. In 2015, for the 2014 year, HR stated that reviews would come with no compensation increase; this would be discussed at a later time in 2015. An increase in compensation only happens when people are promoted or they offer their resignation. When promoted, the increase does not match the fair market compensation for that role. INSIGNIFICANT BENEFITS PTO is constantly being reduced for new employees. Over 20 days used to be offered a few years ago, then was reduced to around 15, and now it's down to 10. Sick days are included in PTO so that means even fewer vacation days. Health, dental, and vision insurance are offered along with other supplemental things like life and disability. However, the health insurance is extremely expensive, around $175 a month for an individual on the lowest plan and the company doesn't cover costs on a tiered basis, so entry level employees pay the same price for insurance as do executives. A 401(k) plan is offered but with no company match nor one being implemented in the foreseeable future. Options are offered but in a very limited amount and how many a person receives varies based on when they joined and whether they were promoted from within to their current position or were hired into that position (promoted employees have fewer options because they received fewer upon hire and are not given an amount equivalent to their new position). NO CAREER GROWTH \/ LACK MEANINGFUL PROMOTIONS Booker is a company where experienced people can go to work on a complex product, not a place for entry level people looking to learn or grow within the company. With little training, it is hard to attain the skills required to move up or to a different department. And even when employees have the skills for an open position, an outside person is brought in to fill the role. This happens for almost all management level roles and above. Instead, useless titles like Senior and Lead are given to employees to keep them \u201chappy\u201d for another year. Additionally, with these titles comes almost full management responsibilities but very little pay increase, the justification from executives being that these are not management positions. Specific goals for teams and individuals are not set by management, nor are performance requirements, so come annual reviews, management can give out any grade and not have to justify their decision. In the Customer Experience department, the VP was able to promote specific people the VP liked without a transparent process for doing so. In Product, people were passed up for promotions for reasons including that they \u201clooked too young\u201d and that they didn\u2019t come in early enough, even though they often stayed late into the night to meet unrealistic deadlines. In Tech, the Director of Back End \u201cconducted\u201d reviews by sending an email with the HR review document filled out; employees had to seek out the Director to get a meeting to discuss the \u201creview\u201d. NO TRAINING \/ NO DOCUMENTATION Booker was built with contractors from day one and that continues today, with a large part of the tech team, from developers to QA, working remotely as part of outsourcing companies. This setup has led to pockets of knowledge and poor documentation of code. Very few people understand the platform well and there is no established way of documenting how new features work and how they integrate into the overall system. Onboarding of new employees is almost non-existent except in the sales and customer experience departments. In the tech department, no training on the software is provided, no development environment and other starting tools are provided, and management provides very little in the way of guidance and training and instead relies on teammates to do management\u2019s job. Booker has held Lunch & Learns to help promote people sharing knowledge but the environment has become so non-collegial that people don\u2019t want to invest in sharing because there is no reward and they don\u2019t feel they are part of a team. POOR MANAGEMENT \/ LEADERSHIP Besides a hard-to-use and complex product, management is the second most likely reason for Booker to fail. They are inexperienced leaders and come from backgrounds unrelated to business-management software development. They believe that hiring more and more people is the solution to Booker\u2019s problems and state that \u201cwe need to hire for this role so that the new person can figure out what we should do.\u201d Ironically, hiring people is not a budget problem, but paying current employees fair market value is a problem. Management has very unrealistic growth expectations that they sell to employees and investors to encourage them to stay and invest, respectively. Sales projections are based on hoped-for partnerships that require a great deal of software development and run time, neither of which Booker has. Unless certain executives are replaced and a different strategy for the company is implemented, Booker is not likely to survive and not a place to bet a startup career on. HIGH EMPLOYEE TURNOVER Employee turnover is a serious problem at Booker. For over a year, Booker's maintained about a 25% per year turnover, meaning that with around 200-250 employees, one person a week, on average, leaves the company. While there are employees who have been there longer, including a co-founder, the average employee tenure is about 1-2 years even though the company is over 7 years old. A majority of employees who have been with the company for more than six months express their desire to leave the company or their unhappiness with the company. Management has conducted numerous surveys to determine why employees are unhappy and are leaving, but few meaningful changes have been made. The biggest complaint of employees is compensation. QUESTIONABLE ETHICS The ethics at Booker is particularly troubling with some stand-out examples. Booker will do many things to market itself to potential customers, including paying employees to direct only satisfied customers who are willing to give a 5 star rating to a software review website and encouraging employees to vote on the best spa software in the American Spas\u2019 2014 Professional's Choice Awards. In regards to the latter, an email from the Director of Brand and Reputation at Booker was sent to all employees stating to vote for Booker but \u201cWhen asked for your contact information, provide your personal email and telephone number NOT your Booker email.\u201d This was followed up with an email stating \u201cPLEASE NOTE: Do not do this from your work IP \u2014 you have to enter from your personal account.\u201d Based on this email, having employees vote for Booker was not only unethical but also not allowed by the awards organization. Booker from time to time will offer an award to people who help out with large projects. Such an award was given out in 2014 to the group that worked on implementing a new enterprise client, working long hours with a very tight deadline. One of the employees working on this project found another job towards the completion of the project and gave his customary two week notice. The award was a baseball game for the team but this employee was not allowed to attend because his last day of employment was the day before the game. Even though he had put in months of hard work on the project and left on good terms, he was not allowed to attend the game. A similar thing happened to an employee who had been with the company for a year and a half and resigned in November of 2014. The employee wanted to attend the holiday party held the first week of December and was allowed to do so but was mandated to pay $80, even though the employee had RSVPed to the event while employed so the headcount was accounted for and the employee had worked there the entire year. The reason for the required payment was because \u201cthat\u2019s the policy\u201d. Another instance of poor ethics and possibly illegal discrimination came during reviews from a manager who told an employee that the employee couldn\u2019t receive a senior title because the employee \u201clooked too young\u201d and \u201chow would that title be perceived by others\u201d. A final troubling development is the opening of an office in Philadelphia. The stated rationale behind this was cheaper office space. Philadelphia is not a tech hub, certainly nothing like San Francisco, Austin, Boston, or other cities with available talent. When asked if other cities were considered, the answer was no. This leads one to believe that \u201ccheaper office space\u201d was not a deciding factor. Given that the executive had already hired two friends into VP and Director level positions, providing jobs for friends was a probable reason. Coincidentally, they all live in Philadelphia and commute to New York for Booker. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if in a few months, these executives permanently work from the Philadelphia office. This would not be far-fetched because two VPs already work remotely, in addition to a large part of tech that is outsourced abroad. Advice to Management Pay fair market salaries and pay consistently among employees with the same or similar roles. This has happened in the QA department but needs to be across the whole company. Provide cheaper healthcare options for entry-level employees and start matching 401(k) contributions. Focus on training employees, whether through online videos like Lynda.com, through continuing education classes, or by hiring managers who are experts in their field and are willing to train their employees. Promote from within for management positions and mentor new managers so they can succeed. Have a focused strategy for the product as it\u2019s too complex as it is and isn't sellable without massive amounts of expensive training for new clients. Choose a market segment and don\u2019t try to please every new enterprise client, especially when it leads to added features to the product that are only relevant to that client. Work on long-term, scalable solutions that are automated instead of short-term patches that require multiple departments spending time away from their jobs to resolve. Stop hiring indiscriminately. It\u2019s a waste of money and not the appropriate solution for the existing problems. Venture capitalists would be happier with a successful company than with a large company. Bring contract developers and QA jobs in-house. It will lead to better knowledge of the product and better communication among employees. Implement documentation requirements so that knowledge isn't lost when an employee leaves.","title":"Good place to socialize, not a good place to work","prediction":"customer"},{"advice":"Let your employees be more creative with their schedule or how they do their jobs.

Cons Like all companies, there are silos that need to be broken down, specifically within the Product\/Tech area. A lack of having a central operations team causes a breakdown in communication and as a result causes territorial issues. Company communication is often after the fact and not pro-active additionally the meeting culture is counter-productive and often unnecessary. The HR team should develop a company-wide rewards program so there is a brand consistency as well as improving the health benefits and considering a 401k match. Advice to Management There is an experience gap at Booker, lots of entry level staff with limited professional experience (tons of Booker product experience) vs senior management and above with years of professional experience (no Booker product experience). Those without professional experience outside of Booker don't realize how good they have it and often are the biggest critics and morale killers. This being said, developing a mandatory product and process training for the on-boarding of all new hires and existing employees will mitigate this and improve the culture -- this is urgent. Continue the fun activities but consider enhancing existing or adding other benefits (medical\/401k match\/bonus) as this is what retains staff.","title":"Great product, great people, fun work environment","prediction":"adaptability"},{"advice":null,"cons":"It's a startup, so it goes without saying that the hours are long and the bar is set high in terms of company goals and performance.","pros":"As part of the marketing team, I have two fabulous mentors with a ton of industry experience who truly care about investing in their team and helping them grow.

They give you the opportunity within a few months to ramp up your own territory and take prospects from cold call to demonstration to close. The product itself is top-notch in most regards compared to it's competitors, so even a fresh college graduate will be able to close deals after being there for only a few months. The culture in the office is casual, yet competitive. It's not unheard of to see someone in a hoodie and jeans speaking with business owners on the phone and closing deals. Plasma TVs are strategically placed around the office and show sales rankings in real-time. Cons If you're a seasoned sales pro who's looking to take the next step in your sales career, be warned: Booker is probably not a place where you will be able to thrive. This means if you're 26+ and you have 1-3 years of sales experience, stay away. Even the most successful sales reps are still making well below what they could make elsewhere. Quota structure begins fresh every month, so there's no incentive for long-time sales associates to stay. This is truly SMB sales and you're dealing with non-responsive, non-business savvy decision makers on a daily basis. Building deep customer relationships is non-existant because once a deal is closed, there is no chance for re-occurring commissions or up-selling. For a platform that is subscription based, you would think that sales reps would be incentivized to build a book of business so they can reap re-occurring commissions as they nurture their accounts. Instead, reps are paid once on each account and obviously forget about that account the second they are signed up. With that said above, there is a gap in the company when it comes to Account Management. If the Sales Reps aren't nurturing accounts after they close, then who is? The only times accounts are managed is when there are issues and there is no structured way of keeping good relationships with clients that have been on. It's not unheard of to hear of accounts that have no been contacted in years due to the fact that the company is simply just hungry for more sales. Sales Managers in the middle levels are somewhat inexperienced, but are extremely driven and trying their best to build the sales team. I give them kudos for building a path for the sales teams without any to much guidance from upper management. Upper level sales management is almost non-existent and is a huge black eye in the sales organization. They create new quota structures and incentives, and then you're lucky if you hear from them for the rest of the month. The only time they communicate down to actual sales reps is when things are very good or very bad. I have yet to see upper level sales management (not mid level) involved in the sales process itself. Lastly, there is little to no room for movement within the company itself. If you're a highly successful sales rep, you're 100% stuck. Unless you want to become a sales manager (which is a totally different role in itself), the best hunters in the company usually wait around for something better or leave. There's no path to Enterprise Sales or any other Business Development for that matter. Advice to Management I recommend upper management reevaluates the hierarchy of the Sales Team. I question exactly what those at the top are exactly doing if they aren't actively nurturing the sales team. I understand today's sales teams must be data driven, but when you have an upper level sales manager who doesn't know the product as well as his most inexperienced reps, it shows. I also highly recommend that you create pathways to different sales opportunities within the company. Some of the best sales people on the floor could be helping the Enterprise effort\/Biz Development effort in middle markets. I still can't understand how the company has 80+ small biz sales reps and only 1-2 Enterprise reps. Mid-Market? Non-existent. I understand the whole start-up atmosphere, but the company needs to begin to nurture their best reps into better positions where they can pursue their career--Or else they will do this elsewhere.","title":"Great for Young, Entry-Level Sales Reps","prediction":"customer"},{"advice":"Fix the system, provide upward mobility for your employees, recognize your employees hard work, stop changing the sales compensation plans, stop treating sales reps different from each other (There is a second class citizen of Sales Rep at this company).","cons":"Terrible communication from Corporate.

Advice to Management Keep the company growing, but be weary of a few things. 1. How you treat your employees - If you want the best, you need to treat them like the best and pay them well, but I respect that you take on a lot of college grads to get them to work. Tech mostly needs to be paid top dollar so you can continue to have a stable and outstanding product. Average to sub par employees will give average to sub par results, and potentially hurt you in the long run. 2. Be fair to your clients and listen to them. Without them, we have nothing. 3. Keep up the positive attitude in the office. Everything your employees and management do reflects upon the company, including cold calling. 4. Don't only listen to your investors. As paramount as their investment was, putting that money into your product is a wiser choice than growing a sales team. Without product failures, we have the best product and people will want it without as much need for cold callers.","title":"Great starting Company in New York","prediction":"customer"},{"advice":null,"cons":"I fear the culture is shifting to a more strict regime.

The location is also smack dab in the heart of Wall St. So for lunch, you'll be seeing a lot of high-power Wall St. execs, which is a great opportunity for networking for another job. Cons Good god where to begin. When I first found out what Booker was, I thought to myself \"Oh man, how cool! People would JUMP at the ability to have this in their salon or spa\". On day one you find out there's a whole industry of this kind of software. There are a million competitors out there, but as I mentioned above, this program is the so called \"Cadillac package\" of appointment software. Problem is, salon owners are so apathetic to what kind of software they're using, they think the software they bought in the 80's is still good for their business. Which leads to my next point. Prior to this job, I was indifferent to salon owners. After this job, I think it's physically impossible for me to be friends with a salon owner. These people are the rudest people you will ever have the displeasure of talking to. They have no concept of right or wrong (or even basic English for that matter). Every day, I had some uppity, white-trash salon owner telling me to go f*** myself. I once had a salon owner to tell me to \"go get cancer and never call back\". I know cold callers are annoying, but my god lady, all I did was waste 30 seconds of your time. The work environment is one giant clique. This is due to the fact that if an employee refers a friend who gets hired by Booker, the referrer gets a bonus. So everyone knows one another. I'm just the guy who found a posting online. A good number of people just viewed me as the \"outsider\". Even saying \"hi\" to some people would result in the inexplicable cold shoulder. Which is extremely bizarre for a company that is trying oh so hard for the \"nu-age-laidback-21st-century-startup\" company look. Briefly to jump back to my point of this saturated industry. During training you do receive information about how Booker stacks up to their closest competitors. The problem is, these guys update their software just as much as they do. So when someone tells you their software has some of the same features as yours through the latest update, you really don't know whether they're pulling your leg or not. Even better, sometimes someone will just throw a name out there you've never heard of, and you have no idea how your product compares to it. Asking for help from your superiors when you struggle is a joke. I asked my manager numerous times to listen in on my calls and see where I was going wrong. Problem is, I had the misfortune of having all the calls I called during this \"session\" go to voicemail. So the manager could offer no assistance, and when I asked if she could meet again tomorrow, she turned it into a whole group activity with the other Sales Associates (all of whom were not struggling). For me, the straw that broke the camel's back came when I asked my manager for new leads to call, these \"new leads\" were all leads that were either out of business, already clients of ours, or asked to be placed on the Do Not Contact list (in simpler terms, people we could not call). Prior to getting recycled leads, we would get leads that had no website, no phone numbers, no business names, and you'd go in assuming they were a business that was right for us. I think I spent at least half of my time there filtering through broken leads. Lastly, there's compensation. It's a base + commission type structure. I have less financial obligations then most of my peers, but I was always very confused how they were able to afford Manhattan's obscene rent prices, while working on this company's salary.
