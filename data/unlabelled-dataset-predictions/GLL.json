However, your outlook on the negative connotations of unemployment may change while working for GLL. Cons I have never worked for such a galumphing group of idiots in my life. Management from the CEO down is a complete farce. Ineffectual layers of management upon management make GLL a micro-managed mess. GLL inflicts a one-policy-fits-all procedure upon all its' leisure centres taking no operational specifics of any one leisure centre into account. This usually leads to a trail of chaos wherever they go. For instance GLL \"dont do part-time contracts\" which presents a lot of indirect sex discrimination and leads to leisure centres desperate for staff at weekends. From the cheap ASDA-esque branding (including the poorly constructed uniform) to the horribly violated health and safety policies and procedures this company doesn't know how to look after itself let alone its employees. Health and Safety doesn't seem to be an issue for GLL. At one point a very busy pool presenting zero chlorine content in the water was far less important than ensuring all staff were wearing their name badges (which carry first and surnames - surely a safeguarding and privacy issue in the year 2015?) Lifeguards were left guarding inadequately lit pools, or for periods of nearly 3 hours. No two members of regional management have the same information as each other and none of them seem to be able to convey important information to operational staff. Legend, The computer system used for bookings and cash register operation is an embarrassment and even Fischer Price would be ashamed of it as a childrens toy. One would assume the ego of the head office cretin who pitched the system to management is being protected by keeping it rather than admitting defeat and putting an actually usable system in place. This system gives reception staff regular cause to apologise to customers (who rather helpfully, have come to understand its inadequacies and are most sympathetic) I could go on but even the internet itself has limited storage space and I wouldn't want to take it all up with this.
