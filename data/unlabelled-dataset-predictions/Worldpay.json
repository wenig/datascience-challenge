I'm not just taking products to sell which are badly needed to make Worldpay be \"leaders in modern money\" - what a joke. They don't deliver dates and they are not accountable to anyone in order for new (to them; existing in the marketplace) solutions that their existing and prospective client base is demanding. They ignore emails and pawn things off to other departments. And the Product team is enormous. The new US Worldpay Total product is nothing but SecureNet witha new name. No new features.

That's not standard for payments processor dev staff. Or any size of this operational structure. But make sure it's in SalesForce because that a major investment, again poorly implemented by head nodders and unnecessary meeting makers so they look good to the big guys. 3. Test and Production platforms do not mirror each other enough to ensure EMV certifications will work in the field. Not to mention how late in the game they were to get there. 4. Core teams who dealt with client EMV certifications were made up of \"boys\" with NO payment experience (terminals, merchant services, POS solutions) and we're yes men to the upper Super Egos. The sexist environment disallowed any experienced female to voice her opinion as she might emasculate these hot shot parrots. I saw horrific incidents where most places would have had security escort someone out the door for then way he spoke to several females. HR was never involved. 5. Product\/Marketing team took personality tests and then all got together in a room to see \" who was what type.\" We kept charts in our mini cubes so we knew where they fell on the spectrum when dealing with them. Thousands on that silliness. 6. And the best - last CEO took all Senior leadership on a multi-million dollar \"Journey\" through Amsterdam and Europe to help them learn to work together. It ended on a yacht cruise on the Adriatic Sea. This is while the rest of us we're back dealing with a quagmire of nothing to sell and no dates. Money well spent - not.
