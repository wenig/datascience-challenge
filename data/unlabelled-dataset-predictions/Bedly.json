An example is calling them \"Boston Bedly Bros,\" which is in line with the \"bro culture\" a past employee cited. -Poor culture. No vision or insight on ever being promoted or getting raises and most contractors feel unappreciated. -High expectations for low pay -No path forward for employment (instead of 1099) or raises -Lack of diversified workforce (upper management is all white men while contractors are mostly minority women) -No transparency. There have been requests for an organization chart for upwards of six months and it still hasn't been provided. -No accountability for management (since they're all buddies) Advice to Management Drop the arrogance and humble yourselves.

Cross department collaboration and impact 5. Compensation \/ Equity is inline with other YC \/ AngelPad backed startups 6. Pretty good benefits for a pre-series startup: medical, dental, vision, 401k (no match), Bedly apt monthly discount if you move in, and gym membership subsidy among others 7.

Little value or care for the customer, very business \/ numbers focused, at the mercy of investors 4. A much smaller company than their online presence seems to suggest; creates higher expectations on the service Bedly provides for the Landlords and Renters 5. NY HQ is a Bedly apartment; pressure cooker 6. Founders are very inexperienced: tremendous risk from a business and culture perspective; rely more heavily on advisers, consultants, part time workers, and other CEO's from AngelPad startups. This reduces the faith in the very team they hired to do the job and claim to \"invest in their careers\". 7. The smartest \/ passionate people end up leaving Advice to Management 1. Don't use the company as a power trip \/ coming of age ceremony 2. Don't scale a business on broken foundations; value best practices and team 3. Don't be afraid to pivot the business 4.

Scrappy startup approach leads to severe operational incompetence; useful for prototyping phase not seed and beyond 8.

The schedule was pretty flexible to do other outside jobs. Cons I worked as a part-time Operations Associate for the company and was initially promised a monthly stipend. Instead, they only paid me an hourly rate, which ultimately never amounted to what the monthly stipend would have been. One of the founders also assigned me additional tasks at a certain pay rate but after a month of doing those tasks, he said he would be lowering the pay by almost half. I obviously declined the new \"offer\". I experienced payment delays and my expense reimbursements were sometimes issued almost a month after the work had been completed. There is a disorganization within the main office of the company which affects the work that happens in the fields. This led to operations being far more stressful and labor intensive than necessary. If you are a student just looking to make some extra money, perhaps it is better than working a fast-food restaurant. However, if you are hoping for a real career or career advancement, I strongly urge you to make your own \"Bed\" elsewhere.
