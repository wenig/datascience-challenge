Office equipment is top notch especially computer hardware: however, the software is terrible usually with offices and divisions sharing a scant number of licenses or seats that would allow employees to take themselves to the next game. Client roster is impressive but any medium-sized advertising or tech agency can easily steal most of their clients. I know because I'm leaving to go to a smaller firm that's opening up a PR shop in two or three months. Cons Most of the employees aren't particularly bright: they don't know any software program other than Powerpoint. In fact, most of them don't even know Powerpoint really well. So, it's hard to give clients \"the best\" when an account executive in Digital doesn't know the difference between Photoshop and Microsoft Paint. You'll quickly find this out when an executive is standing in front of a room of some of the world's wealthiest, smartest, and powerful people with a presentation that looks like a hot mess. It's because, I swear, when it comes to pitches, proposals, wireframes and prototypes... the company employs like seven whole designers at any given moment. And parts of the senior leadership claims to be experts in esoteric and dubious advertising and marketing \"sciences\" but can't even write a lick of code. And we're not even talking about real programming. They don't even know how to do a regression analysis in Excel much less write a function in python or tweak the CSS of a site. And that makes it hard to sell to your clients when you don't even know what a KPI is, how to track it or the technology that makes it work. As they move into this \"communications marketing\" model, everyone should have a basic working knowledge of modern technology in the context of marketing, advertising and media. That means the company is paying an executive a large sum of money that everyone else has to produce and work even more to pay for these wastes of space. Certain employees are there because of nepotism. They're even worse than the know-nothings. That's because they are so insanely stupid they haven't even realized they were hired because of a family friend, spouse or they are related to the client. So, they think they actually know things. These people are morale and profit blackholes. I'm not sure why they aren't locked away on their own floor never to interact with the employees who actually work and are there based off merit but if you have to keep them, isolate them off to their own existence. They also claim you can apply inside of the company and grow as an individual but I've seen about 2 whole people move divisions in the 3-plus years I've been here.

You are expected to work insane long hours since the account folks will sell without regard for the impact on the people who do the actual work. It also doesn't help that the sales folks often have no clue about how to even get the work done. Expect very long work days and putting in hours over weekends.

Edelman is comparable to other large agencies in the area. Cons Company politics run the agency. HR\/senior leaders treat their employees as replaceable, and they're not afraid to admit it. In fact, the first thing my manager said to me was \"no one here cares about your career except yourself\" - if you want to make it here, you have to be cutthroat and willing to throw people under the bus, otherwise you will be the one thrown under the bus, and you won't grow. Edelman also thinks it's enough to pay you with \"you're working for the top agency, so we don't have to pay as much!\" There are PLENTY of better agencies in the area, Edelman! Advice to Management Leave. Many of you have been there too long anyway and don't understand what the world is like outside of Edelman.","title":"Assistant Account Executive","prediction":"customer"},{"advice":"Put the integrity of the work before the contract\/client.

THere's no real need to sell their services outside of the agency and there's always work to be done. Through strategic agency partnerships, there will likely be more work than Berland can keep up with. For the most part, the junior staff (includes entry level through VP level) and middle management are fantastic and have the potential to be even greater with the right training and leadership. Cons Where do I even begin? This company is toxic, starting at the very top. The senior leadership team is highly intelligent and have promising vision, but no one is capable of executing that vision and they're extremely manipultive. They have no respect for one another and that trickles down through the ranks. Their behavior and the way people talk to one another within the company is ridiculous and NO ONE should ever have to deal with that. Agency mean girls = school yard bullies. Another huge problem is that they have no corporate structure - I mean they don't even have job descriptions. Without those, no one has a consistent idea of what they should be doing and what their manager expects of them, so it's a royal cluster of people trying but failing because they don't have the information or resources they need to succeed. The company keeps saying they're going to train the staff, but we've been waiting the better part of a year and have no idea when that training is going to come. The work\/life balance is non-existent. Both Edelman and Edelman Berland operate in a very knee-jerk, reactionary manner, meaning there's a crisis happening every day (maybe every hour) and people are swirling around and around without being productive. Also, it's an intensely meeting-oriented culture, meaning that the real work doesn't really start until 5pm because you've spent all day in meetings. It's high stress, long hours all the time, and PTO is difficult to actually take - meaning instant-burnout. Advice to Management This is actually advice for Edelman management.
