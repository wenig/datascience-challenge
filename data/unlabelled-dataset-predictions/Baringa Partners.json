Partners will back you if you have present a credible case. - Genuinely collaborative: This comes out in two ways, firstly business units do collaborate to try and build the right project team for each engagement. Secondly, unlike some other consultancies I feel like I could ask colleagues for help if I needed some advice or was struggling on any particular engagement, and not have it held or used against me. People want to see you succeed and this overrides most of the personal ambition\/politics\/agendas I've experienced elsewhere. It also encourages people to speak up rather than soldier on into situations they may not know how to handle. - Work Life Balance: In the context of consulting, Baringa makes much more than a token effort to help with this. I know that senior management and partners actively take into account personal situations (e.g. getting married, having a baby, etc) when staffing a client and will not fling someone out to the Outer Hebrides with 24hrs notice.

The annual Baringa weekend away (with families) doesn't hurt either ;-)","rating":5,"text":"Pros I've worked for Baringa for a significant chunk of my professional career, and having come from a Big-4\/6 Global Consultancy previously, I can still safely say that I haven't come across a consulting company that's as good as Baringa. The work is interesting, our clients are as 'Blue Chip' as they come and you get to work with some of the best people in the industry. You really do work with your friends, rather than your colleagues - while this can also be said for pockets of the larger consulting houses, it's not true across the board. The senior leadership truly care about the individuals and maintaining the fantastic culture that Baringa has created over the last 15 years. Even thought the company has grown significantly, there's still scope for real ownership at the individual level, in terms of growing clients, capabilities and also helping to actually run and improve the company. I'm not sure there are too many other consultancies out there that are truly the same. The annual Baringa weekend away (with families) doesn't hurt either ;-) Cons Remember, it's still a consulting company! While we have fantastic and sometimes quite unique benefits, there's still the expectations of the client to meet - be that working away from home or long hours. However, the company does all it can to limit the negative impact of these aspects to consulting.","title":"Still a Great Place to Work","prediction":"customer"},{"advice":null,"cons":"Some feel that the speed of growth over the last couple of years have taken some of the original spirit away.","pros":"Exceptional consulting firm with a difference.

The work here is genuinely very interesting and the exposure to clients is at a much more senior level than at the same grade with my previous employer. The culture is more collaborative and more personal than what you would experience at most large consultancies. Recruitment Process The recruitment process was slick and accommodating. I was still at my previous workplace when contacted by Baringa and the recruitment team were friendly and informative. I went through two rounds of interview - the first with a Manager and SM, the second with a Partner. Before I started the process, I had an informal chat with an Energy Retail Director and was offered a peer-to-peer chat, which was very useful and all helped make my decision to move. The Work Throughout my career I have worked with major utilities and energy companies, but the work at Baringa has definitely been higher profile and personally more rewarding. In the last year and a half I have been providing direct assurance reports to the client programme director and C-suite, being given mandate to act on the remedial actions suggested and drive the change within these organisations. Internally Baringa are also great at providing opportunities to drive initiatives that take the company forward and help drive strategy. In my case, this has included shaping the direct recruitment campaign, heading up internal BU comms or work to identify key energy trends and their consequences for us as a business. The amount of internal work you get involved with is up to you, but the opportunity is definitely there with Baringa should you want it, irrespective of seniority! Culture The people we work with here really do make the company. I have never been refused a request for help or assistance, be that from peers or Partners of the company - it truly is a collaborative place. Working directly with Partners on client and internal engagements gives you levels of visibility and access to senior management that would be alien at larger consultancies. And it's not all about work - every year the company organise several company events, BU events and a trip away where spouses\/family are welcome too. These events are great and you sometimes get the feeling the entertainments team are always trying to out-do previous events, which is fantastic! Cons As the company grows, it is inevitable that the culture will have to adapt too, but in my time here, headcount has gone up considerably and still no sign of a negative shift!

They genuinely care about the company and its employees - they are constantly listening to and responding to feedback, looking for ways to improve the experience for it's employees. 3. Progression - the promotion process is straight forward and transparent. You discuss openly with your line managers and career advisor where you are in relation to the objectives of the next level up. If you all feel that you are meeting these objectives, you are put up for promotion. This happens 4 times a year so if you miss it in one round you only have to wait 3 months for the next.
