As a whole, the company direction seems clear. -Strengthen the communication channels between departments and regions, a simple monthly newsletter does not suffice for delivering collective knowledge. -Try to better organize things from the business side. Events seem scrambled and discombobulated when you do not give a step-by-step game plan for how to work an event. This disorganization is compounded when you have weak communication between teams. -Define a company culture. True, there are \"values\" mentioned when hiring on, but these seemed contrived and vague, at best. Make it a place where people will want to work by establishing a culture that breeds success and motivation. Turn over rate is high because people who do not seem to jive with the team are constantly hired. Take a step back and bring in the right people that will further the enjoyment of others working here, along with the company as well. -Weak company culture, plus all the points mentioned thus far, lead to a low team morale. Constant back talking and gossip are all too frequent within the company. It seems like everyone has several issues that they need to vent about, which should suggest an investigation into overall staff satisfaction. -Greatly improve leadership presence, perhaps even enroll your management in proper leadership training. It may be a blow to your managers' egos, but at the end it will increase productivity and morale. Managers will have a better awareness of how to successfully manage a team and employees will rest assured knowing that their manager has the right mindset to lead. There is an obvious gap between the team and the leader. While it may not be intentional, this gap comes off as apathy towards the team, from the leader. Occasional emails of encouragement, or better yet, team bonding will motivate your employees by letting them know you care. We spend much of our daily lives working for you, why not get to know more about us, and us about you? -Create and encourage more transparency. This partially ties into poor communication too, but the opaque nature of this company creates disorganization and distrust. Things, big things, are going on all the time that are not made known: important people are leaving, changes to the event are occurring, moves being made regarding the naming and branding of events. Even a low level employee should be involved when changes to the event that they are working on are happening. -Invest back into your employee. Before I articulate myself on this point, know that I always feel conflicted mentioning this. Reason being is that we get paid and live off our salary for this job. That, in theory, should be enough employee investment. However, in this day in age, the bar had been raised with tech companies\/ start ups revolutionizing the modern day work place. Provide better computers to your employees, that way they won't waste time trying to get their programs to work or dealing with other avoidable technical issues. Set up team off-sites to encourage team bonding and camaraderie. Look more into employee training programs. These can be great both for the company and the employee. A better trained employee will do a better job. Doing this will also foster creation and innovation.","title":"Not as bad as it could be but could be much better, no doubt.","prediction":"collaboration"},{"advice":null,"cons":"vacation time is limited and high sales quotas. not much room for growth though moving up the ladder is not easy.","pros":"great work place.

The obvious choice by this company was to promote the crappy guy because he was in with upper management. Terrible Pay - I have heard that the starting pay is around $30,000 per year for an entry level job. This is barely enough to live. Lazy employees - My manager seemed to be very interested in what was going on with his iPhone. Other that that he focused hard on his golf game and ignoring has managerial responsibilities. No promotion potential - Because of the small size of the company and the connections that the current managers have made there is no hope that you will ever be promoted Boring work - I joined because I was told about several projects I would be involved in. All of these projects were immediately cancelled or delayed upon my arrival. The workload is reconciling custodian data to statement data. I have had more fun getting an endoscopy. Vague bonus structure - Ask them about their bonus structure if you work there. You will never get an answer as to how it is calculated. They will also lie to you in the interview process about how much it will be. They claimed 1800-2000 per quarter. The most I got was 700 dollars gross. Did not honor my resignation date - When I knew I was leaving I gave them a little bit more than 2 weeks of notice because I knew they would be in a jam. Instead, they told me to leave early and did not pay out my final bonus. Hilariously, I received e-mails at my new job for help! All in all, this company is a joke.
