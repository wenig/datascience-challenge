Risk for example is good, with a knowledgeable and professional person and heard had a huge impact by taking care of the whole deal. Sales has potential. Some have industry knowledge\/connections and one other not as deeply industry-knowledgeable but makes up building human relationships and did almost all the sales though with the advantage of staying for long. Product has one guy driven and clever who also stayed for long. The development team did regular hours, which annoys some but they have a good reputation and somehow built a reliable platform, so actually well done to them. Part of the management is knowledgeable in the respective field and he did well in securing some financing. Also the company is indeed part of an incubator, which gives some advantages compared to a stand alone company. Cons The previous review is a bit emotional (and funny)) but sounds true to me. The reputation I hear around the company is still terrible, both from the people in the incubator and even more outside. The culture felt of dis-empowerement and mistrust and for good reasons, this was not for me a place where you are trusted and not a place where you can trust. Chances for personal development were small for me and if it is possible at all I hear now it's even a little bit worse because they moved (physically) outside of the incubator. I would recommend a friend to pick any other opportunity and not to join Billfront unless she is desperate. I wonder why are the good ones still there or for how long they will stay, they don't sound exactly thrilled. I don't see many positives for BillFront in the future unless there will be a major reshuffling.","title":"I would avoid if you can","prediction":"integrity"},{"advice":"Treat your team members with respect, recognise their efforts and handle them professionally, instead of pushing them around.","cons":"Management team is generally lacking managerial skills & doesn't quite have the reputation within the incubator which one would think they should, aka positive.","pros":"The company's part of an incubator, so there are many nice and clever people lingering around, definitely a good place to network, as well as daily startup perks such as free fruits, snacks, occasional lunch etc.","rating":1,"text":"Pros The company's part of an incubator, so there are many nice and clever people lingering around, definitely a good place to network, as well as daily startup perks such as free fruits, snacks, occasional lunch etc. Cons Management team is generally lacking managerial skills & doesn't quite have the reputation within the incubator which one would think they should, aka positive. The communication is extremely bad. Although there should be weekly\/ monthly feedback talks, don't expect them to happen regularly and to learn where you're doing well and where you need to improve - everything is based on a personal opinion and perception, and if you're not flirtatious enough, don't expect to get too far. If at some point employees decide to confront management, they are afterwords being punished by being ignored and sidelined from company discussions & conversations, and will most likely loose their jobs. The incubator's HR and management team is not stepping in when necessary and in general things are not handled professionally at all. Advice to Management Treat your team members with respect, recognise their efforts and handle them professionally, instead of pushing them around.","title":"Sneaky and arrogant","prediction":"customer"}]
