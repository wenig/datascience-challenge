Efforts have been made to improve interdepartmental communication which has led to a massive amount of constantly changing processes. Within the Quality Department information is mostly passed on at random, if at all. There are a lot of opportunities for extra responsibilities and project management - but you must prove that you can do the job before you're allowed any training for it, and often trainings are offered by invitation only, depending on who managers would like to see advance, not to anyone who might be interested.
