There is no diversity within the group, it's literally the Greenwich, CT lacrosse team Client Group has a tough time retaining talent due to very poor compensation and the fact that most roles within the group are tremendously boring Most managers in the group are there due to it being a progression of their career, not because they are actually good managers of people. For a first job, this can be very detrimental to growth Entire group is tremendously top heavy. Because of this, there's no commitment to education or advancement of those at the associate level. Everyone in a senior position in the group has been at the firm for 10+ years, is buddy-buddy, and is paid at pre-financial crisis levels i.e. junior staff are horribly under compensated for their contributions To those looking into the rotation program, be very wary, as an outsider looking in, the program is just a means to exploit young, talented workers and underpay\/under support them every step of the way. Every other rotational program at AB blows them out of the water. Advice to Management Bring up very poor compensation for junior staff (6% stock dividend!?!)

The culture was insular and a little smug, but there were many opportunities for growth. Some of their capabilities, especially in research and analytics, were superior to their competitors. Both business and IT had talented individuals who moved on to successful careers elsewhere. Cons The environment in the last few years has been one of relentless cost cutting. Many of their best people have moved on. Surviving employees have no sense of direction and purpose, and feel they are treated as appliances. Bonuses have been slashed severely and show no sign of improvement even after the recovery. Management has changed direction repeatedly with no accountability for failure. For example - 1. There was an expensive project to outsource most of Operations. This was abandoned after several years and many employees had to switch jobs from AB to the outsourcing vendor and back again. 2. Similarly, IT employees were relocated to White Plains which was an impossible commute for residents of NJ. The rationale was that the NY office space would be sub-leased to generate rental income,. After a couple of years, this project was also abandoned and the employees were moved back to NY. 3. IT management decided to start a captive offshore arm called AB Solution Center. The rationale here was that by eliminating the consulting middleman, they would be able to hire much higher quality resources who could replace onshore staff. This project also failed - AB did not have the scale to start their own operation, so they reached an understanding with AXA India. Instead of paying more, AXA started subcontracting to the same consulting firms who had been eliminated, but paying even lower rates to preserve their own margin. IT teams spent many months trying to get it to work, but gave up one by one. Of course, this did not save any of the staff who had been marked for elimination. Advice to Management 1. Stop taking your staff for granted. It is not a viable strategy to coddle the CEO and his inner circle at the expense of everyone else. 2. You will not be able to survive just by cutting costs. Your competitors also went through hard times but are making significant investments to strengthen their position in the market. What have you done except outsourcing, off shoring and terminations? 3. Your technology platforms are seriously stale.

By performance I mean ability to garner superior returns on investments. In fact investing performance is not measured.

There's no significant bonus upside but plenty of downside as evidenced by 08 and 09 bonuses and layoffs. Analysts are not the same as DOR\/CIOs. It's pitched that you can retain your career track in an analyst role. But that is not true. Analysts were largely fired during this downturn. Not senior managers. Especially not poor performing managers. If you are going to join the company; join as a senior person. Not an analyst. You are expendable. Research skills, contrary to the marketing angle, are not that important. It's a pretty shrewd strategy. Hire people with significant work experience, who are thrilled to move from a mundane industry they've been working in for years to a sexy 'Wall Street\" job. Pay on average is quite low compared to shops that hire people who have a better sense of comps in this field. This is why marketing of the analysts generally focuses on years of work experience (rather than years of investing experience) and lofty educational backgrounds (M.D., Ph.D. etc) and lofty corporate brands (P&G, GE, McKinsey, etc.). White papers and black papers are produced that look slick and take on important topics. But ultimately the company doesn't want to pay top dollar for top investing talent. It would rather spend that money on managers above a certain level and in the area where the real talent is, the marketing to clients. \"Managers\" don't have management skills. No one is ever promoted or rewarded for building strong teams or providing consistent and timely feedback and helping employees grow. It is up to the employee to figure out what is expected, how to get there, and to ask for all feedback bar mid-year and end-year reviews. There is of course no upward feedback although I believe they are instituting something. There are exceptions but AB consistently has the worst managers I've seen. Promotions of people to the DOR\/CIO management role include some of the worst investment picking analysts. How the promotions occurred is still a mystery to many and created bad blood that exists to this day. It is an overly arrogant culture in terms of brain power. People are very smart but they discount the smarts at other shops and in colleagues. The excuses generally revolve around how other shops don't have industry expertise and industry backgrounds and that AB is more rigorously analytical and fact-based. In some cases that is true but in many cases it is not. Because investment picking performance is not explicitly done or rewarded it's easy to argue away issues. The debacle with the overweight in financials during the economic crisis wasn't a position that was agreed upon by everyone. In fact it was the marketing group who consistently would raise objections and volley questions about analyst convictions on these holdings. In the end they were correct but the response to 'marketing' people questioning investment holdings was treated with derision by the research group.
