The product team continue to expand and enhance the product. After several large acquisitions, of course it takes time to bring the technology into one unified platform. We are on the right track (all tracks have bumps) and we will continue to crush the competition for many years to come. - GREAT customers: We work with many of the world's largest companies across their marketing, advertising, research, care and commerce teams - and beyond. We help solve their problems in order for them to provide positive experiences for their customers. - Work\/Life balance: Good pay and benefits. Work hard, play hard. If you're being micro-managed in your current role, ask yourself why that is? Can you look yourself in the eye at the end of EVERY day and say you've done the best you possibly could and have worked to the highest possible standards?

And rating truly reflects the company current state. I would have given Sprinkr atleast 4 stars but issues below make it impossible to rate the current conditions any higher than 3.5","pros":"All pros and cons are result of characteristics the company has. One really good pro about a workplace because of certain characteristic can also result in really bad and deal breaker con in different context.","rating":3,"text":"Pros All pros and cons are result of characteristics the company has. One really good pro about a workplace because of certain characteristic can also result in really bad and deal breaker con in different context. Sprinklr is going through the same. The transition from a startup to a potential big company is not going well ( especially for its R&D team, which is the engine of Sprinklr). I will try to point out the best Sprinklr has to offer and cons that either were always present or have emerged recently. 1. For me the best thing about working at Sprinklr is the ownership you get for the work, which is completely independent of your length of employment. You joined a team for only 1 week and you are told to do complete refactoring of one of the most business critical component in that module. It makes you feel as if you have a piece in this big thing which is completely yours. 2. Salary. Its really good especially for complete beginners like college graduate. Also everything is in hand i.e. what CTC quotes is what you get every month in your bank account. No cab cost, or sodexo coupons or shares. Many big companies quote huge CTC but only later you get to see that monthly pay is a lot less than what you expected. 3. Technology stack. In some departments the stack is as modern as it can be. Latest technology trends are adapted quickly and pushed in production. But some departments need to update its stack and bring new trends in company. But inspite of old stack, there is tremendous learning opportunity for everyone. Sprinklr will always support you ( especially in monetary ways ) in your learning, you can enroll in online courses, buy books and everything will be reimbursed. 4. Free food. There is a kitchen that serves 3 meals and while the quality of food goes up and down, its overall satisfactory. There is also a pantry which serves tea, bournvita and other snacks throughout the day. 5. Promotion and increment in salary can come too quickly if you are in the right place at right time. Salary increment of 100% is quite common. Employee stock options are also given after promotion. But there are some issues in this whole promotion process which I will discuss in detail in cons section. 6. Surprise gifts. Sprinklr knows how to please its employees. Latest iPhones or foreign trips for entire team after some major milestone happens frequently. Party can be thrown at any day with lots of pizza, drinks and a rock band in office. 7. Potential. Sprinklr has huge potential to be a great player in market because its really at right spot at right time. The innovation and disruption it can cause is amazing and people working here or coming to work here know that they have hit a gold mine. Cons If you see Sprinklr rating trend on Glassdoor you can clearly see it has gone down quite a lot in last one year. And rating truly reflects the company current state. I would have given Sprinkr atleast 4 stars but issues below make it impossible to rate the current conditions any higher than 3.5 1. The biggest problem with Sprinklr right now, which was its biggest strength in past, is its speed. Sprinklr always believed in getting things done at extremely fast pace. Modules\/features were delivered to clients whenever they needed completely disregarding any time limitations. But the bigger and complex something becomes more time is required to change it without causing any breakage. Many people at top are still trapped in old Sprinklr days where things were going at fast pace because there were very little complexities. But they complete disregard that Sprinklr now is a really big company with a mammoth size codebase. Its not possible to re-write a module that was built in past 2 years in 2 days and release it without any bugs. Its not a question on the developer coding quality but your management capability. And if the management doesn't expect it to be delivered in such short period, then be realistic about this and form a proper roadmap with realistic deadlines considering all factors ( available resources, client priorities, regression ) instead of dispatching impossible missions on your team. Tell your team that client need this thing by this time and then believe in your team to come up with best plan. Majority of people here treats this company as their own company ( see pro #1 ). 2. Talk doesn't match action. A company is built on trust. Its importance is paramount. Sprinklr has done a poor job in ensuring its employees that they can put their complete trust in it. While there are great leaders in workplace whom you can always lookup to and you know they have your back, a few people at top have not realised that trust is something that is the key in differentiating between a leader and a boss. And talented and hard working employees need leaders not boss. Trust is broken every time you promise something that even you know is not going to happen. What Sprinklr already provides is great but these broken promises and false hopes are what make employees frustrated the most and they think about leaving and venting out their anger on Glassdoor reviews. 3. Recognition and Promotion Process. The system to recognise the hard working employees and promote them accordingly is never easy for any company but Sprinklr has never paid even tiny attention to this. Promotion depends whether your team is doing well or whether you have good relations with seniors or whether you were lucky to have got some new big features\/modules instead of being stuck in maintaining the existing code and solving client support tickets and bugs. Employees need a proper feedback on regular interval. one-on-one are important and shouldn't happen only once a year just to inform you why you are not being promoted now but could be promoted after 6 months. And even after 6 months of hard work people are not promoted without telling them any reason at all. This may seem opposite to what pro #5 states but its a reality. The variance is astronomically high in salaries but still the worst part is there was no feedback for the past whole year. If particular employee is not doing well, give him\/her a proper feedback and help him\/her. Don't surprise him\/her after one year with a small increment while other people are enjoying double salary. 4. Discrimination between Dev and other staff ( especially QA, Design ). Dev team in Gurgaon experience all the cons specified above but they are also enjoy all the pros mentioned above. Other teams and especially QA and Design team have to deal with all the cons without all the awesome pros that Sprinklr offer its dev team. Low salary increments, no recognition, excluded from foreign trips while workload is almost same. This is one of the reason why platform quality is decreasing because talented QAs and designers are leaving company for other better opportunities. 5. Hierarchy structure. Developers have been running the R&D for quite some time. But in last one year managers were hired from IIMs to aid Sprinklr in becoming a big player. But the transition to a new hierarchy was not done properly. People are no longer sure of their roles and what or how much say they have in the process. This needs to be tackled as it can be the most catastrophic for Sprinklr out of all the cons that are mentioned here. 6. Work life balance. Its not good but most people neglect their health completely which I think is their own fault as its their onus. But if above cons are taken care of then I don't think most people in Sprinklr will mind work overloading their life. They will be happy to be part of something good and big. Advice to Management Walk the talk. Practise what you preach. Talk to employees about their problems. Most importantly don't put unrealistic deadlines or promises that you know are not going to happen. You have a great team and great potential in market. How you handle this phase will determine whether Sprinklr will go in history as a great company or a company that could have but couldn't.","title":"A company in transition","prediction":"result"},{"advice":"Keep going, you guys are doing good work.","cons":"No real interaction with CTO.","pros":"Good food.

Sprinklr was not my first job, I have worked in MNCs and seen the corporate world before landing here. Initial days were tough. It was very fast paced. Everyday there were discussion around creating new products or ensuring that customer issues were addressed in highest priority. I tried to get involved in everything I could, to add value in any possible way. I could find so many opportunities where I can help solve the issue or add value that wasn\u2019t my primary role. In fact, no body cared what roles & designation you are. I love that about Sprinklr. I was given an unexpected hike in the very first 6 months of joining and I was really surprised. In fact, I asked, shouldn't we wait for at-least 1 year? \u00a0 But I realised, I wasn\u2019t an exception but a norm. To recognise and reward as soon as it can, has been always the Sprinklr way. Sprinklr can be challenging place for many people, who want everything organised and defined. It is not a place where one talk about job descriptions (JDs) all the time. It is place for people, who want to solve real problems. Who want to add value to the company and to themselves. Who has founders\u2019 attitude. Who look \/ focus into the bright side of the coin and move forward. There is always so much opportunities, so much work to keep you hooked. You either love Sprinklr or hate Sprinklr. \u00a0And it depends on what you are seeking from your job. It depends on if you are looking for easy or not. For me, it has been a learning experience, much more than I ever thought. It is a place you add value to your self and to the company and create win \u2013win situation everyday. Sprinklr works in a Pull model (not in Push model). Everyone tries to pull highest value adding opportunities to create maximum value. Love this freedom and opportunity about Sprinklr. I wont talk about good food and flexible timings, Goa Trips & outings and best salaries, as you can get that at many places. You wont get a place that make you feel that you have limitless opportunity and you share the founder\u2019s concern of ensuring Customer Delight. Cons Refer to Pros section.

Build goes every weekend (sometimes thrice a week. YES!!) 5. If a customer asks for some feature, managers will agree upon it without talking to developers about the sanity of the existing product which makes the product buggy. (they call them commitments) 6.

Product managers who thinks building a feature is 5 minutes task (Did I say anything about \"commitments\" to the clients??) Advice to Management A lot many 1. Please be more responsible towards the employees. Give them little more time to code than just roaming over their heads about how this feature should be sent this weekend. 2. Ask the product managers to strongly remain in touch with developers about what can be done and what can't be. This is the main reason of buggy product. 3.

The problem with management is not that they are horrid or don't mean well. They simply do not know the product anymore. Some are micro-managers, some have no idea about the product, some used to know but now have been left behind. There is a wave of amazing people who support the management teams and they are left frustrated as unless you are 'friends' with someone in the higher management, you will never progress. 3. Stop telling everyone that everything is going well. Everyone at the company knows that the company is not meeting its goals. Why then do we continue to celebrate every chance we get? Why not knuckle down and do what we do best - Fix things. It makes management look even more deluded when people hear that things are going well when we all know they are not 4. Give the entire product team in India a break and show them so much more respect. I have had the pleasure of working with developers, QA's, Product owners and support teams. They are by far the single best assets Sprinklr has and they are not shown the respect they deserve (read other reviews about offices in India for more context). Instead of hiring new leaders for regions, new managers for people and new executives, why not cut the fat that is at Sprinklr and invest it to double the size of our product team and give them the best working conditions possible? 5.

Disclaimer After reading the reviews, if anyone still wants to join this sweatshop, then they truly deserve this horrible workplace. I wonder if I can find any workplace worse than this. It is screwed up in all the ways possible, all credit to the most crazy, inefficient CTO of Gurgaon branch. I sincerely request the IIT placement committees to ban this sweatshop (company if it can be called one) and save the students. IITians already have a bad impression about the Indian companies and the work culture. Please do not add more oil to this belief. Also the Gurgaon management makes fool of the IIT placement committee, by offering US placement just to get Day-1 slot. They wantedly did not file the H1-b visa application for some of this year\u2019s US offered students, just because one senior employee wanted them to work in the Gurgaon office. Cons Highly unstable product: Lots of poor quality code gets checked in everyday, and they do not have a single unit test the maintain the sanity. The CTO\u2019s principle is to make customers happy (by fooling them). He believes, it is a time waste to write unit or integration tests. To compensate for this, they have a release every Saturday. Developers are forced to push features or fixes very quick, so that any more resulting fixes can be fixed, the next weekend. Any major fixes, occurring from the hasty release, are sent on Saturday and Sunday. So, you have to be available every weekend 24\/7. No quality work at all. Quantity is given preference over quality. Sir culture: You are forced to call your seniors as Sir. Only Sprinklr can have this most stupid culture all credit to you know who. The seniors get offended if you don\u2019t call them by Sir. Egoistic senior co-workers: It is great capability of the CTO, that he could consistently maintain this culture among most of the senior employees (senior refers to more than 1 year experienced). You see 1 year experienced employees shouting on their junior freshers, who have just started learning. It is so very surprising how the CTO inculcates this into its employees. This makes the work place, very miserable and toxic. False promises : The CTO just speaks anything that comes to his mind. Gurgaon is highly polluted and the office is very crowded with no space at all. Till now, he has promised that the office will be shifting to places like Goa, Dharamshala, Chandigarh, Panchkula, etc since 2 years. They claimed they reimburse gym memberships, and after taking them, they refused to reimburse them. Long hours : You are expected to dedicate your life to them, just because they are paying your salary. You are constantly threatened to be fired if you can not align with them. You are under constant pressure 24\/7 due to their inefficiency. A lot of Computer science students are hired to do manual testing and they do not believe in writing any tests and following any engineering process inspite of the company being 8 years old. Please do not spoil their careers by under utilising their talent. If you try take this up with HR, you will be fired soon, as they don't encourage anyone who do not align with their culture to work in the company. So also be careful when any senior employee asks for a feedback. Advice to Management Please strive to make Gurgaon branch, a remotely decent place to work.","title":"Run far far away from this dying and the most hopeless workplace","prediction":"customer"},{"advice":"Outside perspective is good but not at the cost of ridiculous changes.

In the last 6 months, the support team has a new set of leaders. All of them have no idea about the product, process or people. They are not even interested to know how it works. All we get is \"instruction to follow\" and a lot of times it makes no sense at all. They supposedly bring \"best practises\" from the industry but spend no time to understand how it can align with Sprinklr. As soon as they came, they started to fire people at every level. From engineers to senior directors. It was their way of making sure that everyone knows them. They have started again. All we talk is who's next. Everyone is under constant fear. Advice to Management Outside perspective is good but not at the cost of ridiculous changes. Please validate the changes. Someone from the board or the CEO should see if these changes are effective or just show offs. Sprinklr has always been a people centric company. Hire people who matches your culture. It's completely broken in the support team now. Stop treating employees as numbers in a spreadsheet. Where is the human touch of the old leaders? They used to know everyone personally. Your current set of leaders have bread disloyalty and fear. Is that how you want to continue? They sound diplomatic at best and ridiculous at other times. Bring in the old style of leadership.

Cons The new QA management has screwed up everything and now it is not a healthy place for QA engineers. Please take this review very very very seriously else you will regret throughout your life. The biggest problem is the mindset of the CTO,dev leads and QA management. Senior QA managers and Leads are asked to leave in a day. 1 - New senior QA management is toooooooooooo arrogant and always talk about firing the Engineers on the floor. 2 - In last 8 months all the leads are kicked out. 3 - QA management only listens to CTO\/Dev leads and due to some random decision some 40 QA engineers resigned in last 3 months. 4 - QA Management even didn't bothered to retain a single resource, all the talented folks are gone now. 5 - No clear career and growth path for QA. 6 - QA is treated like Slaves\/donkey\/dogs., even the daily wages workers have a better life. 7 - No work life balance, you will not be able to spend an hour with your family due to unplanned patches\/releases. 8 - People are asked to write good reviews on Glassdoor. 9 - Every weekend releases.no one can escape from this. else you will get fired. 10 - QA has to be available 365 days - 24x7. 11 - Have to work on all public holidays, weekends, and festivels in south India. Recently QA management asked folks \u00a0to cancel the planned leaves for Dusherra. 12 - HR team is also helpless, if you and talk \/ complain they can't do anything as CTO is the BOSS here and don't listen to anyone. 13 - If you argue you will get fired next day. 14 - No planning for releases, random patches, on an average some 10 -15 patches are send every week. 15 - Very complex and Buggy product. 16 - lot of layoffs across the board. 17 - Developer with 1 year of experience will scold you.Everyone on the floor talks about just autoamtion but no one understand. 18 - No one respect QA, even Dev leads abuses if there is any miss from QA.Literally bad words are used. 19 - No team outings for QA in bangalore. For Gurgaon team every year there is outings in Goa, international outings. 20 - Developers are also treated like salves but they will team outings in Bangkok \/ Thiland \/Goa 21 - In same company there are different policies for Bangalore and Gurgaon center \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For Example : Team outings, Birthday Gift,Diwali gifts, Low quality food in bangalore office, Difference in laptops used in both the center. 22 - All dev leads shouts on QA., toxic culture everywhere, even the devs are frustated. 23 - Hike for QA is very bad instead of working 24x7. 24 - No insurance for hardware and if there is any damage to your machine\/laptop you need to pay from your pocket. 25 - Time in and time out is tracked. Advice to Management Ask your CTO, Dev leads to give respect QA team, don't treat them as slaves. Be more transparent and respectful to people. Money and Free food is not everything.

Bosses get angry, they shout but then its their job to get the work done and they do this for obvious reasons. But yeah sometimes its not fair and people are hurt, you have to be strong.

And why am I bringing this up? \u00a0Because if I were to plot a heat map of the words I came across during my Sprinklr tenure, the word \"FIRE\" would outshadow every single word. Also, note that I'll be sugar coating things, so don't forget to exaggerate things when you make your decision since the problems listed below only constitute a drop in the ocean. Problems run much much much deeper. So, here we go: 1. To begin with, just have a look at the glassdoor trend of the rating of this company. That alone should be sufficient to ease your decision-making dilemma. 2. Majority of the positive reviews you see out here are from the employees who are just a week (probably a month) into Sprinklr. Reason being, you're begged to write positive reviews about the company as soon as you join (Probably the company also knows that no one can write anything positive once they get to know the company and the culture). 3. Every weekend is a release, so feel free to deduce the most obvious conclusion out of this. (Hint: Working hours. Ring any bells?) 4. Claiming the company is unstructured would be a huge understatement. It is here that you can practically learn the meaning of \"chaos\". 5. The only deadlines you get are today, tomorrow or the coming weekend (if you're lucky) 6. Immaturity is brimming among the masses. I wish I could quote instances (Yes, they are that shameful). 7. The whole office atmosphere is so negative and so robotic. It's more or less like a puppet show. I've never heard a single positive thing from anyone working there, be it a PM, developer or tester. Everyone is stressed out. Everyone is frustrated. Everyone is pissed. 8. Attrition rate is high even if you overlook the firing part. That's why their policy is to hire freshers from colleges who have no idea about how corporate world functions and use them the way they want to and make them work like machines. 9. Coming to the product now, firstly the number of broken features outnumber the number of working ones. Secondly, I don't understand why do they even call it a product. Implementation is a mess and moreover everything the client demands is taken as a requirement (however stupid that might be). Someone please tell them this is not a service based company. 10. You might think of this as an opportunity to improve stuff but trust me, don't even think about it. It'll be a huge disappointment. All in all, you lose your peace of mind, time and everything. That should be more than enough for you to make an informed decision I hope.

Free food, gym membership, parties are some of the perks of working at Sprinklr. You get to work on the latest standards and technology stack and the company puts extra emphasis on learning and encourages oneself to handle any task. You can do what you're passionate about - if you figure out what that is - and speak up. For a third person, the latest trend of reviews can be a little disheartening to see. I have seen this company grow from the ground up to a freaking Unicorn which is an incredible feat in itself considering the handful number of Unicorns without bloated evaluations. The work can be daunting for some and can sometimes push you to your limits where you would be likely to break - but I believe that all these challenges solidifies one's core and helps us prepare to handle any sort of challenges that may arise in future.

Cons The core values of sprinklr which are not followed now: 1. it's ok: When you are not at home on a \"Sunday Evening\", you get calls coz you need to be online \"every single min\", EVERY WEEKEND. 2. Sprinkle, don't shout: \u00a0When this is followed, you won't get hike\/bonus\/etc. Your work will not be recognized, unless you shout and work OR you need to be close to seniors, even if you dont work. 3. Fix, don\u2019t complain: The Manager and other senior folks encourage this and follow this. But when it comes to the seniors(few), God bless their lectures. 4. Never, ever, give up: This is TRUE. they ask you not to give up on work. Even on Sunday Evenings\/ when you're on leave with family,etc. 5. Passionately, genuinely care: This is not true anymore. Sprinklr has changed a lot in the last few months. NOTE: hope this is taken into serious consideration. The main disadvantages of working here: 1. WORK: when a newbie joins, he\/she is told there is scope for learning more. They do get excited and start working and learning. Few months down the line, he\/she will be left with the \"SAME OLD WORK\" (manual testing) and the learning curve falls drastically. if you ask your seniors, then you are told that this is the new Learning! i.e Manual Testing. 2. HIKE: this is the most interesting thing which attracts everyone. HIKE is inversely proportional to what you work on. Factors for hike: a) how good you are with your seniors, b) people talk behind your back about you, \"instead of finishing their work\" just to make sure your suffer, c) Grudge if you dont help anyone senior to you, even if you have a lot of work d) if you are offline for \"sometime\" on Weekends. 3. QA's are treated as SLAVES by MOST of the developers. (I STRONGLY suggest the management to look into this. To get a product to the customer is not just because of coding. there are many other factors. ) 4. Nights are meant to sleep. But you get pings from devs, you need to be awake till everything is fixed and come to office on time the next day. 5. Blame game: If something breaks, May God Bless your day. Everyone will attack you, coz you are paid to take the blame and scoldings. 6. NO WORK LIFE BALANCE :You need to keep people updated while having your food, bath, etc. Be online everyday regardless of holidays, leaves and weekends. 7. Seniors expect a newbie to know everything once you join like incuding the Hotpatches\/Migrations . If something goes Wrong, then pls be prepared for the Roller coster Rider without seat belts and a broken track. 8. Travelling To Gurugram: If you dont travel to Gurugram, then you are going to face some serious consequences, not immeadiately. 9. Leads: SOME leads should know what they are working on, rather than showcasing that their team has more work. Leads compete among themselves, which effects the team members a lot. 10. National Holidays are sometimes cancelled! So its better not to celebrate on national holidays, instead wish everyone on slack and continue working. 11. People who are dedicated to work are given more work. Other enjoy with less work. If you take some time off after lunch then you will be under the limelight. If you goto smoke then you are not questioned. Cons can be continued. But I would want Sprinklr to be great again. (NOTE: These pros and cons are not written to find out who has written. They are written to correct the mistakes. So instead of finding out the person, it would be better if the work is executed in the right way.) Advice to Management 1. Please consider to pay people who work on weekends. Being online every week is not bringing the Work Life Balance. There should be atleast one day where a person can realise they have a life and can breathe. 2. Sprinklr is one product. All the leads, Devs, Support and everyone need to work together which will surely bring a GOOD rating on glassdoor.","title":"False hope and promises by the company!","prediction":"result"},{"advice":"2 stars is only for 1 reason - Founder\/CEO's vision.

Sprinklr's technology advantage will NOT, however, immunize the company from destruction by fear culture and erratic management, as has been imposed by the new senior leadership. It's not too late to stop this company from falling off a cliff - it requires one bold, yet decisive action at board level. It's easy to trivialize these cries for help by believing they come from people 'resistant to change' or 'not cut out for enterprise'. But as convenient as it is to do this, it is equally as dangerous. When people are scared and isolated, productivity drops, collaboration dies and no amount of micro-managing the next month's deals will mitigate the negative impact this will have on medium and long term revenue.

You are paid to work, in fact the salary given by Sprinklr is probably way above the normal standards. So, you better be ready to take up the challenge. Coming back to pros. I can't say about other teams, so i will limit myself to my team: IT Operations. One amazing place to be. Learning curve just sky rockets. What I learned in my 2 and half years there is way more what I had ever learned. You always get to work on the cutting edge technology. People actually listen and care as much as possible. Once I asked for a shower in office and trust me when I say this, I myself never expected it. But turns out the offices premises needed to be redesigned, so during the redisgn a bathroom with a shower was provided. and now think how many other employers will be willing to do that. Forget actually doing it. Its simply incredible. Your work gets appreciated. I can't tell how many times my team members have got something for performing well ( not things like a greeting card or something cheap. Things like 15000 rs coupon or something as costly ). I myself got an iPod nano, a nike fuel band and few other coupons. Considering all these, I dare you to complain about little extra work. As I was part of operations team, our team didn't get to go for frequent team outings, but office parties totally made up for it. Pizzas, Cupcakes, rolls, biryanis used to be usual things. Free lunch. and reimbursement for dinner for support team. Flexible hours. Only expectation was to finish the task under appropriate time period. How you do it \/ From where you do it, no one cared. But yeah, regular status updates were a strict thing. lots of things in office premises for recreation. I don't even want to list them. You start guessing what would be appropriately called recreation for work environment, and it would be there. In fact more. The company is growing in leaps and bounds. and not just the business, company as a brand is taking on the world head on. So a good time to be a part of it. Cons well, glassdoor will not let me complete it if I don't write anything here. so here are something which I think will come under cons: Very bad location of old office in bangalore. Very high traffic in office hours. and I totally hated Sprinklr for it. But that hate was only till my commute between office and house. That office is about to change now (Jul 2015), so not sure if this problem still exists. at times the work pressure gets to you. which is more of a personal thing i feel. But as I said before, considering the overall picture, I dare you to complain. Advice to Management take a bit of control in terms of everything related to employee. I mean how an employee is performing, if not then why he\/she is not. If they have some specific complains. Probably the word is proactive. I feel management doesn't pitch in until its too late. For everything else, its perfect the way it is.","title":"One of the best places to work for","prediction":"adaptability"},{"advice":"Keep up the awesome work!

The management team behind this business puts real value on their human capital and openly talks about wanting Sprinklr to be a great place to work and genuinely meaning it. I could go on for paragraphs about how much I love the company but in summary, it is a place you want to work, and work hard for, because it is a Company that is pioneering its field, understands truly flexible work\/life balance, and genuinely, passionately cares about every single person in the business. Cons This is not a con, but it is an explanation of what some may \"perceive\" as a con. Sprinklr is a late stage start up so it inherently has challenges that larger, more established organisations do not have - clearly defined process, onsite training in Europe, etc. However, the business is working on those things and this is 100% what you can expect to see in a business at this stage. You need to be self-motivated and a visionary in your role. Unless you are joining as an intern or entry level, there will be no hand holding, You will define your own tasks and priorities based on business need. Your manager will support you but they will not dictate everything you need to do. Again, these are not cons in my eyes, these are PROS but to each their own! Advice to Management Keep treating us as adults and caring about our happiness. Your current approach to how you treat your employees is inspiring and it is why I tell everyone I know (and don't!) that Sprinklr is the best company in the world in terms of product, leadership and progressive thought.
