Cons - As said, it used to be a creative place. That has changed recently, and now it's definitely a place with a \"business\", \"entrepreneurial\" vibe. This is NOT the right company for someone with a creative drive who expects to come and make revolutionary adverts. - There's a constant official speech about \"how well we do things, how brilliant our project is\" that doesn't match reality 100% and that can be misleading and confusing, because it goes hand in hand with firing lots of people at once, changing strategies, taking decisions and then never making them happen, etc. - You're expected to work MANY hours. Literally. And of course those hours are not paid. - The values of the company come from minds who are mainly male and mainly white. This is not to say there's no diversity in the office (nor that there's discrimination), but if you have a very progressive sensibility, your feelings might be hurt at times by decisions or comments made by some people. - This is not a place one would like to be at for more than two years.","title":"Not all that glitters is gold","prediction":"collaboration"},{"advice":"Build up trust again with employees before it is too late.
