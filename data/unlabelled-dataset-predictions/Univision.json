Cons - Making a profit is the most important thing to the C-suite and board; hence the re-orgs never seize. - Most of the decision makers are not Hispanic, they do not speak Spanish and are very removed from what it means to be bilingual and bi-cultural. While they know what it means from a text book perspective, they lack the practical experience that goes with it. - Unclear how they promote diversity advancement in the sales\/corporate side. As I said above, most of the executive talent is not of Hispanic origin. (note: exceptions are Miami-talent and local stations) - Management is investing heavily in revamping image that doesn't need to be revamped with new logos for some of the networks. Ironic that we have never seen other iconic brands do this. Think of when was the last time McDonald's redid the golden arches, or when did Nike redo the swoosh or Coca Cola their logos? Never. - Hypocritical views regarding who they really target.

Everyone seems to really enjoy working there and employees take pride in the work they do. Cons The biggest downside of working at Univision, in my experience, is the lack of opportunity for advancement. While there is room for lateral movement, there is no real upward growth. Advice to Management I would advise upper management to provide more opportunities for employees to move up within the company. Also, there are many practices that are still in place just because they have always been done that way.

The recurrent layoffs makes everyone live in a constant state of fear and amplifies management's ability to manipulate employees. Nothing you do is ever enough, are pushed to work extremely long hours with no additional pay. Complete lack of structure, leadership and vision in the company. Recognition and positive feedback are non-existent. In the area where I worked, there's little ability to grow within the company, even when there's talent, unless you know somebody who knows somebody. Their way of doing business, their shows and their products are completely antiquated. Only reason Univision is #1 in some local markets is because Telemundo isn't putting up a proper fight. If Univision continues down this path they will disappear very soon. Worst job I've EVER had. I'll never work there again, it's a place for masochists.
