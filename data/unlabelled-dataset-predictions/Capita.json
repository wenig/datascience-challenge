No consistent or performance related pay increase - pay rised only offered when threaten to leave. No support from management at any level. Advice to Management Take a long hard look at the company that staff used to enjoy working at and listen to the feedback you receive and act on it to learn where you went wrong. Last feedback delivered to you was answered with basically \"I already know\" but as you haven't done anything about it it shows the staff that you know but you don't care, as long as you have the money rolling in and all bonuses are only paid to director level or above. Any request to reward staff is declined due to financial reasons but money is thrown at people as soon as you realise you have driven the most experienced staff out of the door. If the money was availale to recognise talent in the first place they wouldn't walk. The little perks and office environment, as well as communication and recognition for both hard work and service used to make it a company people wanted to work for and to recommend to friends and family. It is no longer a company anyone wants to work at, nevermind recommend to others. Review the sick leave and the reason why people are off sick and respect and reward the staff who have been loyal and hardworking . Recognise their achievements rather than using it as a weapon against them. Managers are there to monitor and review the performance of their staff but it seems their performance is not reviewed and they are left to their own devices with no action taken if they do not meet or even skim the requirements of their performance targets or basic job role and responsibilities. It's such a shame things had to get this far.

They are aware of the fact that they are one of the most promising businesses in the country if they could just get their act together but they just cant seem to work it out. What tends to happen is that management layers will change on a regular basis due to the fact that profits aren\u2019t going up fast enough. The management layers then have political battles or \u2018land grabs\u2019 to increase their Empires \/ chances of success by pulling in profitable business units which creates constant restructures and redundancies. Due to the fact the management layers are constantly changing the restructures never stop, which means that people are constantly at risk. You are most at risk in December, just in time to ruin your Xmas or June, to spoil the summer holidays, which means that people approach the holidays with serious trepidation. People who are good at their jobs generally leave after the 1st or 2nd round of redundancies, which normally happens around 12 months after an initial acquisition. People who come in and are good at their jobs can quickly get overwhelmed with work because people with high levels of motivation are in short supply 'for obvious reasons'. If you are extremely motivated and driven Capita could be the perfect fit for you to develop your skills and climb the ladder as they recognise and promote talent, the issue is the environment created by everything else that\u2019s going on around you and how long you can cope with it. Not all business units within Capita are like this, I have been told that some are good places to work and some people who left while I was there did come back but to other roles. If you are a truly talented sales person Capita will look after you very well and pay you well, but the support you will get from others in the business \u2018for obvious reasons\u2019 will make it very challenging to succeed.
