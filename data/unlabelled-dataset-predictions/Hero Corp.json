From the moment you walk into your interview. 1 - they tell you about the progression but don\u2019t talk about the big turn over. 2 - once you quit, you are basically dead to them, and once you do quit. Boyd will make up stories about why that person quit. For example, Boyd has had over 5 managers at least from when I wasn\u2019t there, who have quit. That is why he took him 8 years and he isn\u2019t even a VP yet. 3 - long hours, 14 hour days sometimes 6 days a week. Boyd has a flashy lifestyle but makes you work long hours. You won\u2019t have time for lunch or dinner. 4 - you will have no social life outside the company. 5 - always told to be positive and 6 - they lie to you about pay. Don\u2019t expect to earn more than 10k a year. Sometimes they will tell you that a customer you acquired cancelled and keep the pay for themselves. 7 - Once you get to leadership they show you how they trick applicants into working for them. If this doesn\u2019t open your eyes, then I don\u2019t know what will. 8 - Boyd will only pay attention to you if you do well. He has his favourites, he never motivates you if you\u2019re doing bad. He will however shout at you. 9 - Boyds history is questionable, he contradicts his own stories many times. He says he got to management very quickly but there is no proof of this. 10. Most of the reviews on here are probably written by him or his staff. Advice to Management Start paying people a base salary, it shouldn\u2019t be just commission based pay.","title":"THIS IS A SCAM","prediction":"result"},{"advice":"Perhaps try to have the interview more structured because it does run on a while longer than.","cons":"It can be a long day and its all on your feet but that comes with any sales role.","pros":"Everyone is incredibly enthusiastic and all of the managers and leaders are really down to want nothing but the best for you.","rating":5,"text":"Pros Everyone is incredibly enthusiastic and all of the managers and leaders are really down to want nothing but the best for you.
