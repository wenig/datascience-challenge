My team and everyone I have come across at Venn Group has made me feel very welcome and it already seems like I have been here ages as everyone has been so welcoming. The social aspect of life at Venn is great. There is always someone wanting to go for a drink after work and social events are put on regularly whether it's within your team or for the whole company. This includes many events and fundraising activities for charity. Fizzy Fridays, held at the end of the month are a winner and a great way to get to know people. I have found that Venn really do listen to their employees holding regular consultation days with members of staff to listen to their opinions and ideas. In the small amount of time I have been here many changes have taken place following a consultation day held in December. Venn value their employees opinions and they listen! I do feel some of the reviews on here are very one sided and I would hope that potential employees would take all the reviews on here into consideration and if you were still unsure, speak with the internal recruitment team and make your own mind up! Cons It would be nice if the pension scheme was better and the company contributed to this more but I have come from an organisation where the pension scheme is extremely generous so the difference between the two, for me personally, is quite vast.
