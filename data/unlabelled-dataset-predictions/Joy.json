Advice to Management Stop focusing on daily operations as the only important thing in the company. Invest money in two areas: get a brand management team, with one clear head of branding who will lead product management all across. Get a seriously talented marketing and PR team and empower them with a good budget. Traffic will increase as a result of brand perception and better product management.

You can make friends for life but that's about it. Cons There is an endless list of negatives so here are the main ones... -Head office is an absolute shambles. Extremely high staff turnover and no one stays for longer than a few months, hence you constantly deal with brand new people who are overworked, underpaid and have no idea about what to do. You receive misleading or contradicting communication all the time but then get in trouble if something isn't done right. -The CEO\/owners are horrible and rude and will constantly try to intimidate you. Lots of inappropriate questions. They have no idea about running a business and genuinely believe that they are perfect - anything that goes wrong is always blamed on anyone else. -Pay is shocking (minimum wage), there are no benefits and you can expect to get paid wrong every month and your expenses will only get paid if you chase them up every day (and then you still won't get them paid back to you for about 6 months). -No real training but you are expected to do and know everything. Lots of stores don't have managers so sales assistants and supervisors are forced to run the store and carry out lots of extra tasks without even a quick thank you or any extra pay. -You will never hear a \"well done\" or \"thank you\" - usually you only hear from head office when they have something to complain about\/something was done wrong\/they introduce ridiculous new rules to make everyone's life even harder. -The clothes are overpriced for the low quality they offer, hence lots of customer complaints and returns. And the staff discount isn't great so most of the staff choose not to wear their clothes either. And the worst part - they are currently closing down about half of their stores, with many already closed (and no proper notice given). Large number of staff are now redundant or will be soon and are owed lots of money, which we will proper never see again. Please do yourself a favour and stay away from Joy.

This isn't down to the team but the directors not having the capacity or understanding of how to run a business successfully and motivate their staff to succeed. However, by far the worst thing about Joy is that the owner is a horrible and strange man, verbally abusive, playing staff off against each other. He often insults his team in front of others and picks on the merchandisers, blaming them for poor sales or anything else he fancied to pick up on that day. I saw him bully a pregnant member of staff in the hope she would leave and maternity pay would not have to be given and he even went as far as describing her as a downtrodden dog - horrific!

Head Office is a different story... Cons The management is awful. Worst company I've worked for during my 8 years in retail, unbelievably unorganized. - Do they know what they're doing? You have to chase them to get your contract after months in the company. Pay is low. Even for Store Managers it's ridiculous considering the stress and responsibilities - an Oliver Bonas Sales Assistant earns more an hour. - No proper training\/induction for Sales Assistant, Supervisors and Store Managers.

How is that suppose to work? - Health and Safety is almost absent. - No benefits. Even in the management team. - Products are poor quality and overpriced. Amount of returns in-store is outstanding! - When some people from Head Office come in-store for a visit they act like God. Not even saying hello to employees, and when they are not ignoring them they prefer to yell at them, insult them, treat them like slave. Rude behavior is normal at JOY. I always had infinite respect for and from my bosses but not an ounce in this company. - Poor communication with the Head Office, where people just ignore your calls and emails when it's a subject they are not pleased about. They just like to scream and shout at you when it's going wrong but they will rarely congratulate or give you encouragements when you're doing good. They lie to employees and talk behind your back. It's not unusual to see employees crying. And that's just a part of the shocking behaviors. -Targets... Ridiculously high, unrealistic and unachievable.

It's the Joy way to have at least 3-4 people leave each month in head office and nothing was ever done about it! It was a common thing to see someone there one day and then never heard of again. It's not normal to have that many people leave all the time, a good company would look into the reasons why people are leaving and change things.

Cons There's a reason stores are closing, the sheer not caring from staff. This feeling comes from no thanks or care being given by ANYONE at head office. Quite a few of the stores I worked in had major rat problems. Head office knew about these and were given a prognosis, yet nothing was done, even 6 months on, the problem worsens, to the point where staff refuse to go to the stock room etc. As a supervisor, you are expected to do everything manager does, whilst earning just 40p extra per hour than a sales assistant (style advisor). And there is so much pointless paperwork - and if you try to do it, you are likely to be shouted at for being behind the till (the only available computers) if someone from head office comes in. There is no petty cash system, meaning if any of the tills are down, staff from that day are expected to make up the deficit, especially supervisors and managers, ridiculous when the management aren't even allowed to use the tills! Returns policy got me into quite a few heated discussions with customers, which was hard because the vast majority of the time, they were right, it's obsurd and unfair to the consumer. So much faulty stock, poorly made clothing, yet even when countless emails are sent to head office after 5 returns of the same item in one day due to the same fault, no product recall is issued, we have to continue to sell unfit goods. Visual merchandisers, well... I have no idea where they found them, but they are all awful! In my time working with the company, we had many people asking if we were a charity shop! Understandable really. Now we come to head office. Wow. The things that go on there, it's no wonder the company is in the state it is! Let's just say some of the ways jobs have been gained are objectionable... I've never worked in an SME with such a high turn over of staff, but honestly, it's easy to see why; this company is on the border of slave labour.

Insults are thrown around the office even when you've done a good job, no appraisals in fact no \"praise\" at all! Laughed at if you ask for a payrise because they can't even afford to pay their own bills. Staff turnover in stores and head office is like no other, you'll be there 3 months max if you're really brave. You can't complain about sexual harassment from the boss because \"HR\" get it too so don't sympathise. Absolutely no progression, you'll be pawned off to other departments because people leave all the time so don't expect to do the job you were employed to do.

Cons Where do I begin I could actually write a book about the cons of working at Joy, lets just say it would not be pleasant. I liked Joy at first but then my opinion changed after the things I had witnessed. \u00a0A major deal of stress is put on the managers and supervisors to meet unrealistic targets which have been set. Work should be about doing something you enjoy not fearing which member of head office is going to call you and give you abuse about why target has not been met. The dress code is absolutely absurd, they tell girls to dress up for work like they are going on dates, they expect a full face of make \u2013up to be worn and if you don\u2019t wear make up they will send you home. They must think they are running a brothel if they have rules like that. (I do wonder which numpty came up with that rule)\u2026 this is Joy not Harrods. The pay is absolutely awful they run a zero hours contract which means you cannot be guaranteed full time hours so if you have rent or bills to pay good luck with that .You will never get a pay rise there and there is no career progression what so ever. They make out they do not have no money which is actually a complete load of bull, they do and its just they spend it on the twits in head office. The staff turn out is actually crazy, the amount of people that leave or get fired is actually funny. It actually makes me wonder why people stay there as long as they do knowing the business will be six feet under in a year.

They don't care about there staff which makes us completely unmotivated and lazy and completely and utterly bored.

There stores are so quiet and makes literally no money and guess who's to blame for that?? Us. Managers and supervisors are completely stressed out because of the abuse and rudeness they receive from head office! But the worst part of all is that everyone works without signing a contract which is very strange to me. The ceo has been sued many times for sexual harassment and is talked about daily by the staff.

Managers tend leave every 6 months when they realise what they have gotten themselves into. The company has unrealistic daily targets that need to be reached and who get's blamed if no one goes shopping on a Monday morning or afternoon? The staff who work in store. No motivation, no encouragement from anyone. If HO don't motivate managers and supervisors, then the senior staff won't be bothered to motivate and encourage Style Advisors. This is probably all due to there being no incentives or rewards for what you do and largely down to the pathetic salaries\/wages Joy offers. Zero hour contracts are a huge issue in today's retail and commercial industries. Although the Law states you are not legally obliged to accept work and the employer is not legally obliged to give you work, Joy still expects you to drop everything for them and work shifts that are best suited to the managers\/supervisors preference and schedule. They even force you to come in for your shift when you are infectiously ill. Whenever you are unable to turn up for a shift, it affects the entire team meaning someone else has to close\/cover or everyone has to rush their lunch breaks or even alternating 15 minute breaks. They can cancel your shifts or tell you you're not needed whenever they want, but when you're unable to work certain days, they complain. They are exploiting young people who desperately need money and are not aware of their rights. Managers\/Supervisors publish the rota so late in the week, you can't even plan your your life in forthcoming weeks. They even cause a huge fuss when you're entitled to annual leave or lieu holidays. They fail to tell you at the beginning, that your role as a style advisor also includes: a doorman, a security guard, a cleaner, processing delivery, VM and fitting room assistant. Most of the time you're just standing around doing absolutely nothing, bored to death. You're not allowed to sit down, you're not allowed to have a snack, you cannot be one minute late, you're not allowed to move from where you've been allocated in the store and god forbid if you laugh with anotherr Style Advisor. The store\u2019s dress and appearance code is extremely sexist \u2013 girls are meant to wear make- up and dresses, but what if you don\u2019t like to wear make-up? Surely just because you\u2019re a girl doesn't mean you should wear make-up? It is the toxic and catty environment that leaves you feeling sour at the end of a shift. You\u2019re meant to be a part of this team, yet Managers and Supervisors in particular are very nasty.They gossip and talk about each staff member to you. For a while you think they only come to talk to you about stuff, but then you realise that they inappropriately discuss employees to everybody, including yourself. This is all down to plain boredom - everyone is just bored working there so they look for drama to entertain them. Supervisors, especially when Managers are absent, believe they can do whatever they want and believe that different rules apply them. How about setting an example for your colleagues? On the whole Joy is a very unprofessional place to work: HO, Managers and Supervisors will talk down to you and senior management will talk behind your back. There seems to be a lack of respect for each other. HO doesn't respect senior management, so managers and supervisors then don't respect Style Advisors. Whenever an employee gets another job and wants to leave, Managers and Supervisors become very nasty, jealous and bitter at you moving on. Advice to Management Get rid of the two owners for a start - it's a family run business offering know experience, qualifications, leadership or visions for the future. Really look into the Managers and Supervisors you are hiring, some of them can barely compose a sentence in an email. Again, really look into the people being hired in HO. Especially those who work closely with the owners \u2013 get them to work a full week in store and believe me they will gain a different perspective.

Interesting that head office chose to let the store I worked at go over a month without a manager and traded just fine, then suddenly a policy is introduced where managers are not allowed Friday, Saturday or Sundays off. Health and safety training or a sufficient team to deal with such matters are non-existent at Joy. Unfortunately the store support manager is too far stretched trying to train the high turnover of new managers, so while she was great at her job there is simply not enough time for anyone to receive enough training at Joy unless you are fortunate enough to find yourself in a store where the past or present team created their own training procedures.

You'll notice at least one of these issues in any department or store at a Joy. There is a large focus on customer service at Joy, which is always good to see at a retail level, however you are pressured to strip back your rotas in order to cut wage costs to the point where there are only ever two of you in store, therefore it is near impossible to give good service where you and your team are multi tasking to cover the whole shop floor. This is frustrating when you want to excel in mystery shops (mostly in order to keep head office off your back).
