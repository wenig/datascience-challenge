Most employees know they are underpaid, and the philosophy of getting a raise after you are in a job for x amount of time is something that is said, but not seen in practice. I don't think they understand the negative work environment this creates. As a company that provides competitive compensation tools, they should be embarrassed that their own employees feel this way. What's more, employees are hearing excuses from upper management. Actions speak louder than words, and every employee is watching this unfold.
