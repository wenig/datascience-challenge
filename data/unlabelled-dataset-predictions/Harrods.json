Cons You are essentially treated like a number, the company does not care about you as an individual. The company will constantly display and advertise that they are a top employer however at times it really did not feel like I was working for one. Nepotism and favoritism is rife. Your hard work will not get recognised unless you play politics and are in the circles of management. There have been times where customers have given me excellent feedback directly to my management and managers brush it off, however, when your a couple of minutes late to a shift, management will go out of their way to penalise you, this was one of the main demotivators for myself as it made me not want to come into work as I did not feel valued as an employee. You could always exceed targets, however, management would always ask for more and would not reward you unless you're in their circle. However they would always be more than happy to penalise you. You could be the keenest employee, however with whats stated above, you'll be brought down one way or another. Many of my colleagues wanted to get onto the management program however this only went to people who the managers liked and it was certainly not meritocratic. This led to good employees leaving to other companies where they were valued more as they were being prevented from progressing in Harrods. As mentioned in another review, the above is one of the main reasons why there is an attitude of people just sticking around in Harrods just to get the name on the CV and then go somewhere else to actually build a career, progress and feel valued. As mentioned, management have their own circles and will discuss, gossip and disclose things, many of which they really shouldn't to other managers, this made me feel very uncomfortable in approaching my own manager for issues that I may have been having as I knew it wouldn't be dealt with professionally and other management that you may not get along with would also know of your issues which would, of course, contribute to gossip in the workplace. In regards to benefits, benefits were actually good, and then the company got greedy. The company decided to cut our discount on sale items, which a lot of staff were not happy about as most of us mostly bought from sale and used our uniform allowance in conjunction and got really good prices. As a replacement, we get offered one-day trips to amusement parks as a 'thanks' from the company for our hard work, which is a bit of a slap in the face as I rather have an improvement in benefits for employees rather than one day trips to amusement parks which is just an attempt to make the company look like they really care about employees. Management would spend all day in the office gossiping and as soon as they would hear a director was doing a floor walk, they suddenly they have a burst of energy and do everything they can to make it look like they are doing their jobs. I met some lovely clients (most of the clients were a pleasure to deal with) and colleagues which I will never forget, however, there were a lot of nasty, bitter and power-hungry people working in the company aswell. Sales associates would unethically steal your sales which would cause a lot of conflict between staff in general and management would often turn a blind eye as it at least meant that the department would be making more money. And I don't believe I have to elaborate in what certain management acted like as I think I went into a fair bit of detail above. Overall, the only reason why I would recommend someone to work in Harrods is the name on your CV as it still remains a good name on your CV and is respected. I would just advise someone to do their time in Harrods, earn a bit of money whilst doing it and move on to another place where they will be valued and be able to develop. Advice to Management Please hire people that have good social skills and have good personalities. Most clients can see through a fake persona just to make a sale. Filter through management and monitor employee satisfaction as well as figures. Try to at least combat nepotism and regulate circles that management has as they are unprofessional and create a hostile work environment. Please stop with ridiculous briefings. Especially on Sundays. It is clearly a way for management to act like they are doing something productive to upper management so they can play their bit of politics and hopefully progress within the company. These briefings are pretentious and I want to be treated like a professional, you'll see people that have been in retail for 20 years running around in briefings for 'games' which is just demeaning, to say the least. Please for goodness sake, discipline sales associates who think it is okay to steal sales, it is very unethical they are practically taking money from your pay check and putting it in theirs.","title":"An eye opening experience","prediction":"customer"},{"advice":"- Take care of your staff like you did in the old days","cons":"- Too many concession staff and most of them don't care Harrods and Harrods staff","pros":"- Good and diverse staff discounts, 33% on most own-bought items and concessions.

Cons 50p for a cup of black coffee management feel they own you and manage you as an asset - not a person. The red tape you have to go through to get anything done has to be seen to be believed again - management - create their own little circles and encourage employees to do the same leaving some people left out - the ones that are left out are the ones that will be preyed upon. Seriously - if the managers didnt keep acting like they own the bricks in the walls the place would be more pleasurable to work in. EVERYBODY runs out the door at the end of their shift. It is guaranteed that nobody wants to be in there longer than they have to be. There is no loyalty to be seen anywhere - between the staff, for the company, for the staff. This lack of loyalty is also partially why managers just dont care. everyone who works there are there to get the harrods name on their CV before moving to a place you can actually build a career. Control - you will be micromanaged with pointless rules and procedures. there is a rule for everything. And most of them dont even seem to have a proper reason. For example, if you work in the perfume section, you are designated a floor tile to stand on (EG the second tile to the left of the hermes counter) and you have to maintain your pose for the duration of your shift. Disciplinary for talking to your colleagues on your shift or being seen in a group larger than two - yes this actually happened... if you upset your multi-millionaire customer, they will be quick to remind you that you are basically just a peasant there to serve their every whim. Then your manager will repeat the same thing to you before your written warning. In head office there is actual fear of upper management. Just like in the movies, when they walk in the room goes silent and people try not to be noticed. Middle management suck up to upper management for example by scalding employees in their presence so it looks like they are doing their job well. On the outside Harrods is beautiful - on the inside it is a dark dark place where happiness and laughter is punishable by verbal warnings, toilet breaks are monitored, and everyone acts like they are happy to be there until you you speak to one of the staff (any of the staff- - just try it) and the truth comes out. Advice to Management NO - you don't own any of the bricks in the wall - NO nobody cares that you are a manager in harrods, Upper management are not gods, We spit in your coffee when you aren't looking, and we know the reasons you are managers is because outside the office you are nobodies!
