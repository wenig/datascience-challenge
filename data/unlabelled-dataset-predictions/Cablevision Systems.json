Good luck getting an approval due to a new system which requires every expense be scrutinized by the budgeting committee. - Sales people are ridiculously underpaid. - Annual bonuses aren't what you think they are.

Free cable benefits, pay for equipment only and option of free medical benefits. Paid sick, personal, and vacation time. Cons They micromanage everything. Everything is based on performance. Schedules are not very consistent with a shift bid every 6 to 8 months. Bidding and schedule is based on metrics throughout the year. Coachings are done two times a month. Easy to give writes ups and finals for small things. The more work you can do, the better. More work for the same pay. No difference in pay for bilinguals. They take both interactions in English and Spanish for same pay as representative that only takes English calls. (This no longer an issue since they have outsourced these Spanish calls to the Dominican Republic) They penalize you for using your approved time off. They call theses patterns. You have approved sick,personal,and vacation time but if you develop a pattern on how you use your time you ended up with a write up. I feel that you should attain a write up when you have called out with no approved time instead of the other way around. They do not approve time off with no pay. You can increase from Customer Service Level I - III. Once you hit the cap, no more growth unless you apply to a different department. Mentally straining job dealing with all kinds of people, providing accurate information, apologizing for misinformation and meeting your numbers every month. Advice to Management Fight for your customer facing employees. With this new company owner, they have important information and do not share. If employees are at risk of loosing their jobs due to the new sale, say something. Communication can be improved. They communicate constantly but they add false hope and leave a lot of grey areas. New CEO is cutting costs and outsourcing in great volumes. Previously, under the previous owner, there was no outsourcing.","title":"Roller Coaster Ride","prediction":"customer"},{"advice":"Please stop the politics, and commend your great employees.","cons":"Very poor job SECURITY..no future","pros":"Great Benefits and Great Pay...","rating":3,"text":"Pros Great Benefits and Great Pay...

If a customer has an issue you cannot help you have to tell them to call an 800 number, which is awful I just sold this person and told them that we will be there every step of the way to help by then when they call for help I can't help them?? Makes no sense. Three competing department. You will lose sales to inbound weekly. You will build report and sell a customer by then they lose your card and call our 800 number thinking I will get credit for the sale meanwhile the inbound caller will get the credit and commission. That is unfair. And the inbound team constantly messes up and does not give he customer what hey need for the business and how can they?
