These multiples in this short amount of time is pretty fantastic. In addition to this, they're backed by top tier VCs suchs as Goodwater Capital, Valar Ventures, and Coatue Management who have a solid track record in their investments. The team seems to also have a pretty solid monetization plan going into the long term. All these signs are encouraging, especially at a company this young.","rating":5,"text":"Pros - Funding: The company is in a very good place with funding right now, since launching about 2 years ago they have already raised their Series C in July 2017 raising their total funding raised to $78.75M.

The team seems to also have a pretty solid monetization plan going into the long term. All these signs are encouraging, especially at a company this young. - Leadership: For a startup this young I feel that we have a mature leadership team in place, not in a \"stuck-up business person\" kind of way, but they're able to lead by example (with great work ethic and compassionately) and have clearly had a wide range of experiences between them. In regards to the co-founders - they're great, I personally feel they strike a nice balance between business and fun and hope they keep it up. - The Product: We're in NYC and there's a lot of fintech and adtech out there. It's nice to be able to work for a product that doesn't make the rich people richer byt actually helps lower the barrier to investment and financial education for everyday people. Also, it should lead to some extremely interesting challenges when it comes to scaling both on the company side and product side. - Pay & Benefits: Given the stage of the company, we're actually offered fairly competitive salaries and benefits compared to other companies in similar stages. Hopefully they continue to improve! - Diversity: The team overall is fairly diverse across the board. In terms of gender diversity in tech (male, female, non-binary) I think we're around average (or possibly even slightly above average?). As we continue to grow, I'm pretty hopeful that we can improve on our current metrics - actions our leadership has taken have shown they care about fostering an environment that all kinds of people will feel comfortable in. - The people: We have an interesting mix of people from all different companies from agencies, startups, and some major players in the tech space. Everyone is really smart, passionate about the product, and are just fun people - there's such a wide range of personalities on the teams from introverts, ambiverts, extroverts, etc. I've really enjoyed all my colleagues so far! Cons - Processes: Being a fairly young company, we don't have everything figured out yet, there are some processes that need tweaking and some processes that need to be straight up built out. - Work hours: As a high growth startup this is NOT a traditional 9-5. While the company is flexible with the work hours let's be real that as a high growth startup there may be some extra hours put in whether it's in the office or at home. Still, you won't be worked to the bone. The company is in a good place where they can open headcount if there is a proven need especially when teams are getting overwhelmed. In addition to this, I've noticed that we've had several team members with families (with their own children) who are able to manage this - so it is doable. Advice to Management Continue to keep hiring great people and a diverse team. It's really great to see that leadership stays back and hangs out with everyone after happy hours.

We have an exciting roadmap for the future, and a level of transparency that I've never been privy to in any of my roles. Additionally, as a woman, I feel completely protected, which seems to be a rarity in tech these days. Our cofounders sent an email out last week in regards to yet another tech CEO who was accused of sexual harassment. Their policy is zero tolerance across the board--use intimidation or make people feel unsafe and you will be terminated. Lastly, they actually invest in our growth through continuing education, training etc. --Our team: we work with an incredible group of passionate, driven, hardworking, team-oriented people who are motivated to win. People are looking for ways to work together, rather than looking for ways to undermine each other. And fun seems to creep into every single thing we do. . .way more than coworkers, my colleagues are my friends --Our trajectory: we are a legit rocket ship right now.
