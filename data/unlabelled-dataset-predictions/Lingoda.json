However, after many emails telling them that I was unable to sign up for any classes on their website, they made several excuses, told me i was accidentally denied access to classes, they gave me a weak apology and then blocked me again. They keep sending me emails telling me that there is nothing wrong and that i can sign up for classes. I keep telling them that NO i can NOT access the page to reserve a class. Then I get another email from a different person at Lingoda and I have to tell them the same thing again. And I have absolutely no doubt that I will get another email from another person at Lingoda TODAY with the same questions as the last email from them. This has been a big waste of time. My gut tells me that if they have this much trouble with communicating with teachers that they probably also have problems with paying teaching correctly and on time.

English is the office language, but you can hear people communicating with each other in more than 4 languages every day. As mostly everyone at Lingoda is as well learning a new language, this is the best oportunity to practice - and the free online classes at Lingoda help with that. - Diverse job profile and posibility to bring in your ideas: The job as a Teacher Manager offers a very diverse set of tasks which resulted for me in a very varied and attractive job profile. This included interviewing and communcating with different people and departments but also to deal with different topics each day. Based on the daily meetings you keep track of the processes going on in the company, which goals are next to reach and you can see the relation and the importance of your personal task. As the company constantly grows this position offers a huge posibility to bring in your personal ideas. - Very supportive team: I made a great experience with the cooperation in my department, as I worked with colleagues where we worked on our projects really identifying as a team and with a manager who was very reachable and supportive, valuing our personal impressions and ideas regarding the processes. This created a very nice working atmosphere. -Start-Up Atmosphere: The company is well located in Mitte and offers a modern Start-Up atmosphere.

Lingoda is also proud of their multicultural team and proactively encourages everyone to learn more languages. Few business concepts can see multilingualism so naturally at the core of their everyday practice. - Friendly atmosphere in the office: the human quality of Lingoda's in-office team is hard to beat. Going for lunch with someone from a different department is always a lot of fun, since everyone is always happy to share good moments with you. Smiles and friendly comments in the corridors and in your own room are a part of your daily routine. Keeping this positive atmosphere is also one of management's top priority when hiring (finding a \"fit\" with the team). I have made friends in this company that are going to stay in my life for a very long time. - Cool concept: a language school operating online. Brings together the positive elements of offline learning (having teachers and classmates, following a curriculum and having a certificate after completing a level, using a communicative methodology) with the flexibility of the e-learning world. Learn languages when you want, at the pace you decide and from anywhere with qualified teachers. You decide the topic of the class, don't need to buy separated materials and subscriptions are inexpensive. - Great environment to learn: Lingoda offers you the possibility of working in a real start-up business environment and gather first hand experience while contributing to the company's overall success. If you are willing to take on more responsibility, the heads of each department answer positively and provide you with the necessary means to grow in your position. Hard work and dedication is always recognized and there is also flexibility in defining the range of tasks you are to perform. Even though there is a certain degree of micromanagement at start, once past that period you get a full range of responsibilities (as was my case). I profit enormously from every single day I spend in the office and every challenge raising up while performing my duties. - Good salaries for in-office staff: clearly above the average of Berliner start-ups. - Monthly meetings to bind the team together, sometimes during working hours. Cons - The product does not profit from the social element it possesses, which is precisely what makes Lingoda attractive: the website should include some kind of social network element which allows students and teachers to communicate through the platform and which makes it easier for them to book classes together, organize language exchange events, etc. Truly memorable moments happen with people we care for, and they also boost language learning processes. The platform should encourage that. - The product should take more advantage of the technical possibilities that the online world offers: video, audio, interactive materials, etc. should definitely be in the road map for the immediate future. Adobe Connect is also not the best technology for group classes. The company is, by virtue of its very concept, in an exceptionally good position to explore all the advantages of blended learning, but this is sadly nowhere to be seen. - The official communication channels in the office should be improved for both clarity's sake and for transparency. Management is already reacting to this, but in the long term, official and effective interdepartmental decision-making processes should be enhanced and created where needed. Using Skype as the main communication tool is also not a good help. The recent efforts in explaining core decisions and being open to do Q&A sessions (allowing for anonymous questions) are already a step in the right direction: that of closing the gap between management and team. - Even though management is always available to hold a short meeting to deal with anything, I believe that there should be official and formalized channels for feedback to be given bottom-up, from team to management. Advice to Management You have an amazing concept in your hands, allow it to evolve naturally into what makes the biggest difference between Lingoda and its competitors: make the best out of the people that support the product by building trust and loyalty among teachers, students and staff; and also out of the possibilities that e-learning opens up for you.

Die Arbeit ist sehr angenehm, man lernt viele Menschen aus verschiedenen Kulturen kennen und kann nicht einfach nur Erfahrungen in dem Beruf sammeln, mit etwas Motivation und Spa\u00df kann die Arbeit auch Vollzeit f\u00fcr einige Zeit zur Berufung werden. Cons Nun seltener, aber immer wieder gibt es technische Probleme, besonders mit dem Gruppenklassenraum (Adobe Connect). Etwas, gegen das Lingoda nicht viel tun kann, aber ich denke, dass einige Lehrer sich hier ein wenig vernachl\u00e4ssigt f\u00fchlen. Ich z.B. geh\u00f6re zu den Lehrern, die in diesem Fall versuchen die Lerner \u00fcber Skype zu erreichen. Allerdings kommen diese nicht immer online, da viele auch nicht \u00fcber die beinahe regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Probleme Bescheid wissen. Der Sch\u00fcler gibt dann an, dass ich nicht da war und ich bekomme kein Geld. F\u00fcr jemanden, der diesen Job momentan Vollzeit macht, kann das durchaus zum Problem werden.
