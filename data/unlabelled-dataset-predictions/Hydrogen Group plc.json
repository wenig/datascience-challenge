I was made assurances from my first interview that Hydrogen's approach is different and that they are doing all that they can to lift the reputation that surrounds recruitment as a whole. Having been here now near on 6 months I am pleased to say that the Hydrogen approach IS different, the need to develop long term relationships with lawyers is their main focus, they work collaboratively with them to plan their careers rather than coercing an individual into an imperfect move to make the quick pound. The approach to training their staff is quite remarkable and I feel armed to discuss the marketplace at length with any type of candidate. The support of the training team and other consultants is always there, with a smile, if you ever feel unsure or need a little help. The ability to earn money is there from the off because of the unique way Hydrogen structures its commission i.e. working with both candidates and clients can make you money. Once training is complete and you begin to work with clients it's also handled incredibly well in that consultants are handed a number or warm clients as well as targets to develop and make their own. Lastly, the culture is a million miles from that of legal practice, which has felt like an incredibly welcome change. The reward culture is high and being made to feel valued has had a surprising effect on my happiness at work. Success is met with congratulations within the team and the competition between staff is healthy and well meaning rather than cut throat. All in all a very positive move Cons The training could possibly be a little more condensed to allow those wanting to progress quickly a bit more of an accelerated process.

I have come on with 3 years recruitment experience and was promised in my interview \u201cto look after a warm desk\u201d. The truth about this is that Hydrogen is a major player in the recruitment game, on a global scale. For the first time in my short recruitment career I have transformed from a recruiter into a specialist consultant recruiter, trust me there is a huge difference. \/\/ In 5 months I feel totally comfortable in my role \u2013 with colleagues, managers and believe it or not my director. Hydrogen is split into a few sectors: Life Sciences, Business Transformation, Finance, Legal, Oil & Gas, Technology & Power \u2013 each of these have their own Director. I can\u2019t comment on other senior management but I can certainly approve of the Life Sciences Director, Steph Murtagh who backs every consultant in her team completely (around 25 people \u2013 15 contract recruitment \u2013 10 perm) \/\/ So, pro\u2019s of working for Hydrogen? The big one.. Money. Yes, get ready to double your paycheque every six months. It\u2019s ridiculous. The commission\u2019s structure is fantastic. There are incentives for everything to keep on achieving.. With hard work you get rewards. Simple. I\u2019m not unrealistic though I appreciate money doesn\u2019t just fall into your lap \u2013 but if you work hard like all Life Sciences do in a year you will be easily on an OTE of \u00a360k\/70k+. I\u2019m serious.\/\/ Realistic targets \u2013 I don\u2019t need to elaborate on this. But the best part is.. in a 1-1 with your manager you can move your KPI targets depending on what you need more focus on (EG. Candidate short market, more candidate calls than manager calls) \/\/ Another pro? Location. 2 minute walk from Monument station \u2013 tubes are never \u2018overally crowded\u2019 on that circle line therefore getting into work is hassle free (but then again, no excuse to be late). \/\/ I mentioned earlier transforming from a recruiter into a specialist. I absolutely mean this. If you want to be better, Hydrogen have the tools to make this happen. The team, the connections, the experience, the continual development training, the directors, the investments, the international business trips, the dedication and the time from everyone ensures you can make it as a specialist and get away from being a \u201chigh street recruiter\u201d like I used to be. \/\/ I genuinely love coming to work. Things are going very well for me and Life Sciences team members. Cons Not every job is perfect. Even more so in a sales environment. We are salespeople and there are cons. \/\/ The length of hours. ANYONE in a sales environment should know recruitment is not a 9-5. If you\u2019ve assumed it is, think again. But Hydrogen is notorious for early starts \u2013 late finishes. If performance is dropping, hours need to be made. I work a minimum of 10 hours a day, my social life for most week days have gone. \/\/ Large divide between the Hydrogen. I mentioned earlier that Hydrogen is split into a few sectors: Life Sciences, Business Transformation, Finance, Legal, Oil & Gas, Technology & Power.

So, it was by complete chance that I applied to Hydrogen. As luck would have it, I couldn't have picked a better place to start my career. Instead of dull and menial tasks, I felt like I was given responsibility from the very beginning. In fact, every month at Hydrogen thus far has been a great learning curve. I work with some great colleagues. They're supportive, witty and, most importantly, work hard. I'm constantly given new targets and regularly receive feedback from my management team. As a result, I know exactly where I am in terms of my progression and what I should be doing in order to improve. I've learned that time-management is key to everything and to keep pushing even when you feel you're getting nowhere.

Too often candidates are added and left completely or partially unskilled (having said that, the Hub training is pretty comprehensive and organised). More company-wide competitions to encourage a sales culture should take place. If people have to hit certain KPIs, for example, then this should be more standardised i.e. everyone HAS to make 40 calls per day irrespective of your practice. I find the cultures between various desks and practices vary quite a lot. Some desks and practices are great. Some have really good team leaders and a mature atmosphere. Others, however, do not. Advice to Management Don't forget that the growth of APAC is also due to the economic growth of many emerging markets. It's no surprise that we're experiencing a boom there due to the disparity in talent between home-grown recruitment firms, with far less experience and capital, compared to foreign recruitment firms, like ourselves. Get your act together when it comes to taking new consultants onboard. The gap between one consultant and the next is, at times, ridiculous. Be as picky with the sourcing of our consultants as we are with the sourcing of our candidates. Much more discrepancy is needed when trying to find consultants who actually have a decent work-ethic and who can quickly understand what their candidates do. Get rid of certain team leaders. Far too many loud-mouthed consultants seem to have been promoted to positions of authority purely because they've billed respectably for a few quarters.

They then bulldoze in without thinking of the client or the candidate - just trying to make quick money, a very unintelligent approach and a poor service to the client. It is not a pleasant place to work and it is somewhere I am very ashamed to be a part of. Advice to Management If you want a quick fix to sell the business- then fair enough. However, if you want a business that is successful in the longer term then you really must re-address everything that is being done, and make better informed, more careful business choices. Don't take my word for it, I urge you to ask clients and candidates what their impression is and I am confident my above comments will be echoed.","title":"Good at first but the company has completely changed and is a poor example of a business and treats employees badly","prediction":"customer"},{"advice":"It had a good environment back in the day but the atmosphere deteriorated over time.

It was a competent team of recruiters and that's why I joined them. I felt overwhelmed to make a move out of the company due to some poor decisions the management team made. One was about the commission structure which was poorly handled. They changed it and told us about it 20 days after they implemented it. If anything, it should have been announced 3 months BEFORE the implementation. Then we had a massive exodus of Perm Consultants- no surprises there. They changed it back eventually, but the point is that if that has changed the way it did, ANYTHING else could change overnight in that company. My main advice to the management is to start looking after the staff and stop lying to yourselves with your \"Best companies to work for\" accolades. It means nothing and can be easily fabricated\/manipulated. Another advice I wanted to give is for Mr Smeaton as he's been applying a lot of pressure on teams and consultants to make money at all costs and we can't even take your full 1hr lunch break sometimes. All that stress and fear so he can boast about his helicopter and mansion.. Not cool!","title":"Was a good company back in the day........","prediction":"result"},{"advice":"Start reviewing team leadership and holding team leaders accountable for their team's performance (as well as their attitudes) instead of getting rid of more junior members of the team just because on paper they may seem easier to replace.

The sell is that it's a quick fire way for graduates to earn a fair bit of money with uncapped commission, work in a dynamic, vibrant environment where you work hard play hard with clear opportunities for progression. Unfortunately, not one bit of this sell is true. There is no work\/life balance - standard hours are 8.30am - 6.30pm on paper but realistically that's 8am post 7pm most days of the week. Some practices also impose compulsory longer hours if you aren't reaching your targets. Salaries are very poor compared to competitors as is commission structure. Leadership appears to be quite poor across the practices. Within my practice area I felt there was a real lack of professionalism from team leaders who were quick to offer their opinions on more junior members of the practice. There's very little loyalty in the business but at the very least you should expect that your team leader values the work you are doing and the contribution you are making to their pay package every month (team leaders all get a percentage of their consultants' commission...) opposed to voicing their personal opinion on individuals. It felt like being back in high school and it's generally a very unpleasant environment to work inl!
