This is common knowledge. To be promoted one has to show up with performance (whatever this means), mainly on client projects, get proper appraisals and so on - so far, so good. To become a Principal Consultant you need a proper consulting history, you need to express some minimum seniority (also in years of experience and relevance of experience), and overall there are some rules which are also officially communicated: you have to bring in business or at least perform as project manager for a while, be responsible for some minimum revenue, manage a team and of course you need to have and demonstrate relevant skills. These skills have to be related to the business such as subject matter expertise, methodology and so forth. But if Capco promote people to Principal Consultant in high speed, who have nearly never been billable, nearly no important knowledge about the business, nearly no client project experience, who cannot really be seen as consultants at all, then this is going a beyond a joke. People who provide marketing material and support well in project proposals are truly useful but this is not consulting. Promoting those people to Principal Consultant - especially if you compare their profiles to those of other Principal Consultants - is inappropriate. This exceeds any tolerance regarding unfairness.

Though it is about 20 years old there is still kind of start-up marketing what leaves an impression of innovation. It is a very diverse company - the people are not like clones. Cons The ability to take criticism - also in public reviews - has still to be trained. Especially in recent past the promotions prompted questions. It is more than just suspect if employees get promoted to career levels though they are far away from meeting the requirements of that levels. In some cases it seems to be much more political than performance-driven - whatever the motivations of the promotion-responsible persons are... By taking a look at the usual Principal Consultants (one above Senior Consultant, one below Managing Principle), these are people with firm consulting experience, having built up sound expertise over years in fields which are key to the company and the industry. They take sales responsibilities and are also measured against those (there are monetary targets to hit) and - of course - they are responsible for managing revenues, projects, people, and for topics dealing with the business to attract clients and to win projects. This requires hard work and experience in both dimensions, numbers of years and intensity. It gets multiple employees' attention if someone gets promoted to Principal Consultant level without having any notable consulting experience during his\/ her time at Capco, and the previous promotion to Senior Consultant already appeared very generous. There is no base - neither by applying the officially valid performance assessment framework nor by applying common sense - to promote employees to Principal Consultant level who have very little client project experience and thus have not generated much revenue for the company. Internal projects - also in cooperation with the parent company - represent a lower level of comparability, and they generate no revenue (we all know that Capco is not a non-profit company and the billable component is one of a few hard performance criteria). Aditi onally, it is more questionable when the same employees with little or no client project experience do not even stand for any topic important to Capco's business, be it from the financial industry's business or technology side. As a conclusion those very fast promoted employees cannot be seen as consultants at all by this what they do. What is going on then? Officially, Capco does have a quite comprehensive and clear performance assessment framework. And the performance of people who get promoted has to be sustained over a period of time. So how can it be that people get promoted if they don't do management consulting at all and simply cannot meet the framework's requirements? They do not even meet the requirements of their current level - what might sound mean but it reflects reality. It just sticks to facts. The roundtable process should fairly assess performance and skills and determine whether the requirements of the next level are met. Apparently, Capco is not very consequent in this process. And the majority of hard and well working, experienced and skilled employees, who generate business and demonstrate management work, gets mocked. The theory what Capco has set up concerning the performance assessment looks pragmatic and reasonable. Nevertheless, recent promotion incidents showed that the roundtable assessment sometimes tramples on the framework and promotes people for arcane reasons. Advice to Management Train your ability to take criticism and don't think that all employees believe you everything. Stick to facts, especially when it comes to performance assessment and promotions.","title":"Unexplainable Promotions","prediction":"customer"},{"advice":null,"cons":"Bill themselves as being disruptors, but most work is generic pm augmentation or basic BA\/Testing work","pros":"Great people and culture","rating":5,"text":"Pros Great people and culture Decent benefits Good flexibility Cons Bill themselves as being disruptors, but most work is generic pm augmentation or basic BA\/Testing work Not very meritocratic","title":"Good Culture, Average Work","prediction":"collaboration"},{"advice":null,"cons":"Continue working towards diversifying project opportunities outside of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)","pros":"Competitive benefits, great access to upper management, clear advancement opportunities.","rating":5,"text":"Pros Competitive benefits, great access to upper management, clear advancement opportunities.

Since we were part of the organization and had vested our careers in its leadership, we tend to become delusional on that regard. On top of that, there is no transparency on how they rate their employees. There is an out of date process for performance review and no one actually took it seriously. Projects - the official definition of changesouring is: absorbing part of a bank, convert the department into Capco consultants, and receive contracts from the bank doing the exact same thing. The problem is, these work that the banks were performing, they were the most unwanted kind, hence zero value added and career killer. Capco would repackage their very own employees to their clients as staff aug, but since no one trusts the \"Capco Consultants\", the IT side of the bank would give Capco the absolute worst kind of IT jobs, such as, testing - the kind that other organizations outsources to India or Latin America. Engagement partners- when a consulting firm sells a project, there's a SOW and a clear objective of what to achieve, be it standing up a platform or transforming a business. That\u2019s how things work in the consulting world. In Capco, the partner's objective is to provide unqualified bodies at a below market rate and let the clients figure out what to do with them. Since the banks are getting \"FS consultants\" at a dirt cheap rate (compare to other consulting firms) and no commitment of employments, they are more than happy to take on these contracts. It saves them a lot of cash in a long run. Think outsourcing - but locally. Hence, changesourcing!! The partners - they don't care. Contracts are signed, moving on to the next client. They do, however, spend some effort into branding and creating optics that they were directly competing with Accenture, IBM, or Big 4. Learning and Training \/ HR - all the cons written about learning and training is 100% true, especially the quality of the HR department. However, I do highly recommend people joining the Capco HR department. The career path is super aggressive since you are closer to partners and best of all, you don\u2019t do anything 7 days a week, 365 days a year!! The fact that they have pre-determined\/robotic response to different types of negative Glassdoor feedback tells you how genuine they are. Culture \u2013 the consensus #1 aspect that all \u201cCapconites\u201d are truly proud of. It\u2019s true, at one point I was proud of what they stood for in innovations and technologies. Looking back, I can\u2019t stress how delusional that was. Delusional is truly the right and only word to use because when you are an employee constantly staring a propaganda emails (see above on leadership), your emotion runs high on their beliefs and mentality. All the campaigns about digitalization, crowd funding, humanistic, disruptive, beyourseflatwork, etc. They really get into your head. By injecting these jargons into their employees, they create this culture of exclusiveness where everyone thinks he\/she is starting a revolution like in Les Miserable \u2013 creating that \u201ceither you are in or you are out\u201d mentality. The truth is, since every consultant is doing pointless project work (refer to projects) and spends his\/her 9-5 working on \u201ccontributions\u201d that gets them promoted, everyone is brainwashed to believe that Capco has most radically innovative minds in the world. Try criticizing or commenting on their propaganda, their culture would organically phase you out. In a way it\u2019s brilliant by their leadership to keep the morale high! People \/ Hiring \u2013 If you don\u2019t stutter and look grateful, you are hired. At one point, because they need to fulfill a staffing requirement for a client, they literally were sending out offer letters to everyone who applies. I actually did recruiting for them as my \u201ccontribution\u201d and I was told that we HAVE to \u201chire at least 3\/5 from the group\u2026but don\u2019t lower your standard\u2026but pick 3\u201d. I almost got into a fist fight on how none of them qualified and they ended up hiring 4. Advice to Management Stop campaigning that you are innovating. Testing a user friendly website for a bank is not an innovation. Stop enabling this toxic culture where you and your associate best friend is working on a \u201ctop secret\u201d internal project (or somewhat the same concept), thus creating this low level arrogance due to the whole disruptive non-sense. This is how you create that exclusiveness that everyone here in Glassdoor has a problem with. Hire a top consulting firm and have them give you an honest reality check. All these internal \u201cstrategies\u201d are obviously done with a bias and everyone knows you are not really cutting into MBB\u2019s market share. But hey what do I know\u2026maybe it happened already and they have been throwing us the \u201cdisruptive\u201d bone.","title":"Glorified sweat shop, zero leadership, frat house mentality","prediction":"customer"},{"advice":null,"cons":"Inability to scale - especially to execute very large contracts","pros":"Innovative thought leaders, leading practices focused on Capital Markets","rating":5,"text":"Pros Innovative thought leaders, leading practices focused on Capital Markets Cons Inability to scale - especially to execute very large contracts","title":"Great organization","prediction":"customer"},{"advice":"If you want to Form the Future of Finance, do more than Staff Aug.
