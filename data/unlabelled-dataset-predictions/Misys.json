Lots of open discussions and collaboration - your voice is heard throughout the entire development lifecycle. Depending on the team, you may get to build new features, work with modern tech, and help guide the direction of the product. Dev, QA, Product, and Sales all work very well with each other. Management trusts their engineers and stays out of their hair. Very little micro-management. Good work\/life balance, plenty of PTO, flexible hours. Solid benefits. Good location, really nice new office. Cons Legacy codebase, lots of time spent on maintenance and not as much focus on new development. Not enough focus on modernization or clearing tech debt. Custom, in-house framework means developers have very little support or online help. Often, your questions can only be answered by a handful of people (the transition to Angular is helping with this, however). QA is undermanned, so developers often end up taking on that role to a degree (not always a bad thing, but it's extra stress that you aren't compensated for). Not much upward mobility, only a few promotion slots between each level. Advice to Management Cleaning up tech debt should be a higher priority. Deprecating the custom framework will pay off down the road, and more resources should be put on that project. QA needs more resources.","title":"Great environment, solving interesting problems, legacy code is becoming a pain point.","prediction":"collaboration"},{"advice":null,"cons":"If you have an allergy to change and hard work, this will be a tough place to work.","pros":"Strong focus on culture, investment in talent and growth.","rating":5,"text":"Pros Strong focus on culture, investment in talent and growth.
