It is appreciated by the customer and looks very professional. As an employer, it provides quite a great amount of employees benefits and the communication between teams is excellent. Friday beers are always highly appreciated and it is easy to make good friends there. The company and the people are pretty young and very multi-cultural. Also, there is (still) very talented people working in the company and this is a great ressource to learn a lot from their experience and skills. This is a very challenging environment which makes the tasks interesting and permits to gather a maximum of various experiences while being creative. The IT team is working with the last and trendy tech and always has room for experiences that can improve the user experience or the life of the employees. The Care Team (Customer Care) is very appreciated and it can be seen through the reviews provided on the website and the Brand Ambassador program. Digital Marketing looks challenging and probably requires even more creativity and so does Brand & PR.

Also, it is easy to find startups in Berlin that provides similar advantages, but where employee satisfaction is viewed as one of the main goal (it is useless to only measure it...) and taken seriously into account by the management (and not only HR). Also, salary can be pretty lower than other similar startups in Berlin and the environment is not rewarding or not rewarding enough to compensate these problems.","title":"I would not do it again: used to be great.","prediction":"collaboration"},{"advice":null,"cons":"Would be cool to have a ping pong table in the office :P","pros":"Great concept with huge potential that aims to help people in-need!
