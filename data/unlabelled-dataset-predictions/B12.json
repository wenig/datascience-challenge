Snacks, good working tools. Cons - Unethical management: They interview and hire people for one position and then have them perform tasks totally unrelated to the position they were hired for. - A lot of false promises are made: 1. Growth opportunities: No growth at all - management prefers to tire you out for you to leave, rather than promoting you. 2. B Corporate and 1% pledge: They claim on website to be a B-Corp and be part of the 1% pledge, which is not true at all, as they are not listed as B-Corp, nor do they follow the 1% pledge. 3. Sick days: You are not allowed to be sick. If you're sick, you're expected to work from home. - No respect of your free time: you have to be available over email and chat long after work hours, on weekends, holidays, sick days, and when you're off. - Personal issues are divulged publicly - Management has no vision and no idea where to head to, which causes a lot of misleading communication, contradictory instructions, worthless supervisions, too many needless meetings and waste of time. Lack of people skills, no aptitude for leading, at times even passive aggressive management style. The work-life-balance is bad - lot's of unpaid overtime. Salary inequality.
