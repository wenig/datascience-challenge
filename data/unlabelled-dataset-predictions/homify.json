Everyone is supporting each other as you are all in the same position. Cons Where to start?! I wonder if the managers have ever worked properly before starting this company. As every start up, you get told that there are flat hierarchies and the bosses are open for feedback but that is definitely not the case. Be prepared to have managers who dont take your feedback at all and you being blamed if you ask questions out loud, as you should be focussing on your 'actual' task. Further, you are being treated as just another number in the system. There is no approach for the long run and the staff that brings in the biggest and fastest numbers (even if they are not true) gets further than honest and genuine employees. This leads to an immense competition among your team and is a strategy that can give you a burn out easily after a year or two. Threats are being rephrased as so called 'opportunities' and discrimination against women from staff in leading positions has been experienced as well. There is no way I can recommend this company to anyone and I cannot believe that the good reviews are actually true. Advice to Management - Strategy: Think for the long run. That means that rather than creating bad content to bring in numbers or do everything you can to sell, you should think maybe why people are not buying the product and make sure to create that one first in a sustainable way. - Staff: Appreciate them. Starting by appreciating and acknowledging feedback, going over to getting more involved with them through an open communication and ending with celebrating overall successes rather than highering the pressure, so everyone is competing against each other.","title":"Sales Manager","prediction":"collaboration"},{"advice":"More communication with the employees.

Once I got hired, I enjoyed the on boarding experience from learning every detail about the product as well as getting to know each department more closely. A big plus at homify is that from day one; you receive a lot of responsibilities. You will never get bored because a lot of opportunities come along the road. If you want to be even more pro-active within the position or company, you can always talk to your manager to discuss more challenges and responsibilities. I really appreciate the feedback culture homify has - every 3 months, an all-round feedback evaluation takes place. And every quarter, everyone in the company can anonymously participate in the employee survey. From the past results, the management has made some important changes that really affected the company in a positive way. Personal development - Every few months, the company offers several work- shops to everyone. From Leadership, communication to negotiation workshops. Or if you want to go to an interesting conference, there is always budget to make this happen. Additionally we can rent business books from our own homify library. Great culture - Everyone is working really hard to reach the company goals, however in our lunch breaks we hang out with each other as well as on Friday evenings, we enjoy a good talk and having a beer together. Every other week, someone organizes(ping-pong) competitions, to gather all the departments together. Every first Monday of the month we gather for a Company Meeting where we talk about last months achievements and the goals for the upcoming month for each department. Every second Friday of the month is reserved for Fun only, where new employees will be introduced and we celebrate victories together.

They have fresh fruit every couple of days and we shared good food from all over the world. The friends I made in Germany are the ones I met at work, thanks to the esprit de corps we made. The salary was good for someone who starts a carreer in Berlin. Cons Where to begin? 1- Fake reviews are the best way to see this company crumbling to its grounds, which I experienced from around the second week of work. 2- In the last six to eight months, the CEO started firing key people who made the company grow in its first two years and made them expand their markets. Good leaders who didn't agree with the \"fast changing pace of events\" proposed by the CEO almost every month, changing strategies with every change of winds. Even if start-ups need to make fast decisions, once a company grows, it needs to find a balance and a long-term strategy, which they lack. 3- The leaders weren't changed and all decision powers started being held by the CEO, who clearly doesn't have the experience to run a company. They say a General is only as good as its advisors, specially when losing battle after battle. The CEO would create numbers out of thin air to reach unreachable goals in the times he asked, and started losing money fast. 4- The content team was expected to increase traffic by spamming the internet with low quality articles, low paying freelancers, some of them down to 4Euro a piece, which became the standard at some point. They would make strategy meetings where they wouldn't listen to any intelligent proposal. 5- After a short period of exponential growth, numbers plummeted down. The management didn't want to understand that the algorythms of Facebook and Google were punishing us for spamming, nor listening to any of the voices who were saying that only a long-term strategy of less articles of much better quality would change the tide. Their \"new\" strategy was to use collages, click-bait images and titles and other ways of tricking clicks into our website. Ater a couple months of numbers going down they fired 8 people from editorial, without remorse, then a second wave of 7 two months after. Who were they? Those who had the guts to stand up for the team. The ones who smiled, noded and clapped every bad decision stayed. 6- Fear was the key to keep workers silent, specially those who came for a first job in Germany and depended on their work visa to stay long enough to go on. Some of them were fired before that time and are now struggling to find a job fast. Advice to Management If they want to keep the company afloat and rise again, the first thing they need to do is hire new managers and ditch the university friends who are now in power. A seriuos CEO knows the diffference between friendship and work, and will surround himself with those brave enough to challenge his bad decisions. He will listen and act upon it. A serious CEO will be patient and know that exponential growth is not always possible. Only hard work and analysis along the way will help any project grow steadily. This company had no patience nor serious data analysis. If this company is not willing to change its ways, maybe filing for bankruptcy, selling their database and starting over would be the better way. Maybe the CEO should first start as an employee in a bigger, more serious company and gain the experience to manage, as \"a General needs to learn how to follow before he learns how to lead\". I hope they will listen to this reviews, to their people and think twice before they go on.

While I worked there people had to buy water from their pocket money and be reimbursed later. Not only that, but toilets were dirty and they even had a smoking and disgusting drinking room that employees were forced to use as the lunch room. 3- They change their minds every minute!

I would even go as far as calling the boss, \"a corporate sociopath\" - in case you haven't heard of this term, just google it!
