Coffee and fruit provided Cons If there was a way to not give any stars I would explore that option. Just a terrible work experience all around. Comodo simply tries to steal clients from their competitors with ULTRA-AGGRESSIVE calling and sales tactics. You are expected to make 120-150 calls every day and log about 3 hours of talk time. Longer than 15 minute breaks are frowned-upon. This place is the sweatshop of call-centers. And you are on top of one another, can barely hear yourself think most of the time. Highly unprofessional in every aspect. \u00a0One of the biggest regrets I have was wasting over a year of my 20's at this joke of a sales job. Might as well be tele-marketing. Not a true inside sales environment when leads are absolutely destroyed from being called multiple times a day from different reps. Some companies claimed they were called 60 times a month. Management is virtually non-existent. Only care about your most recent sales numbers and that is ALL. Very short leash, extremely high turnover, very little guidance from team leads. Even the tenured managers only care about their own tenured reps, and feed them leads\/sales once in a while. Managers should be helping reps close deals! not micro-managing and checking calls and talk time every few hours, announcing them for everyone to hear. One week of LOUSY in-house \"training\" where you learn the bare-minimum of the product set. WORST marketing team, cant even call them marketing, as they spend most of their efforts tracking call numbers of sales reps and reporting them to management. Company never spends money on advertising or getting their name out there, other than on their own websites. OH and they deploy dirt cheap promotions that undercut sales reps deals by turning a 1-2K sale into $100-$300 sales. Reps lose sales to re-sellers of the company. As you can see I can probably keep writing all day about the CONS OF COMODO, but I have better things to do, working at a REAL COMPANY now. Good luck!

New Hires are expected to sit in a cube and sell over the phone without product knowledge, nor any suggested easy to understand selling techniques. That is because NOBODY there has any. 3) Because of the new hires inexperience and eagerness, they are taken advantage off.

The result, if the he gets bored or finds out you can outshine him, the chances of getting fired are very high. 6) Comodo also have A LOT of uneducated and incompetent people employed.
