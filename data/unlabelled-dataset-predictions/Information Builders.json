A simple trial was a huge pain, and this created many missed opportunities... Most people hitting their numbers were selling to existing customers. Selling to new accounts is always difficult in IT but my management's expectations was not consistent with the realities of rebuilding a territory. Reps who needed to generate new accounts to achieve quota were held to the same pipeline building metrics as reps with existing accounts (number of new opps\/week, meetings\/week, etc.). A steady flow of critical emails and messaging emphasizing our failures in hitting activity metrics, lecturing on \"accountability,\" subtle threats, and a heavy dose of micromanagement was one of management's answers to the region's challenges. Constant inspection and reviews was the norm. Building a territory is very taxing and realistically takes 18-24 months in this business.
