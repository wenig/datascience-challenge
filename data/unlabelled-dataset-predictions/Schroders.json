Top management & HR are unaware\/inactive when (in rare cases) middle management acts poorly or treats subordinates unprofessionally, often taking years to fix problems and\/or waiting for employee turnover to fix the issue. Much of this is par for the course across finance but this company is no exception to the rule. Advice to Management Stick to an internal business plan or structure for more than 3 years. It will literally pay dividends.","title":"Great employees, decent business, poor people\/talent managers","prediction":"customer"},{"advice":"Make promises that you are 100% sure that you are going to keep.","cons":"Management makes false promises to attract young talents.
