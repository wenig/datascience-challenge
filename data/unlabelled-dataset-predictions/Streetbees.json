The food on Wednesday lunchtime and the staff, removed from management layer, were good and the old office was quite cool.

This was primarily caused by the CEO, whose actions were at best, horrible, and at worst, downright abusive and bullying. The company is controlled singularly by the CEO and the COO is only there to back her up and force people to do what she says. You will never be given autonomy You will live in fear You will watch interns be shouted at regularly on the floor You will see staff members leave only to be replaced with more interns You and your colleagues will work nights and weekends, only to be told you aren't working hard enough.

The CEO doesn\u2019t understand that people need a life outside of work and expects people to be online 24\/7. The bottom line is that she utterly focussed on the detail and control, and lacks all empathy. It\u2019s sad as the business has great potential. Amazing employees are brought on-board to bring the business forward - but they soon realise that everything needs to go via the CEO who micromanages everything. A waste of such great talent.

Some of the brightest and nicest staff I\u2019ve worked with. Among non-management, a strong feeling of togetherness in adversity. Cons Short and medium-term strategy utterly lacking, but I reaffirm the longterm plan is good. As has been mentioned in other reviews, the CEO is overbearing. The atmosphere is toxic, no decisions but hers matter and these are taken without input. The result is unfeasible projects being agreed to at too low a price and with too short a timeframe. Staff are expected to abandon all other activities to deliver, but feedback upwards about the business capabilities is ignored. The CEO is personally responsible for all the negative aspects of the business, but is enabled in this by the cofounder who is incapable of providing a moderating influence. Personal abuse is not unheard of, and management repeatedly have inappropriate conversations relating to individual performance loudly on the open floor. This contributes to the poisonous atmosphere. Advice to Management Choose aspects of the business to consciously delegate and stick to it Restrain your selfish impulses to demand the most but offer nothing but bile in return Don\u2019t tell staff that you have a working assumption only 30% of them are worth keeping If you want to post false reviews, best to do it on a workday \u2013 it\u2019s more convincing","title":"Toxic","prediction":"customer"},{"advice":"Just take some time off and let the team you hired do the work.

Cons As several people have mentioned, Streetbees has a massive turnover of employees. Most people leave within 6 months (before their probation ends) and I even saw a few people leave after just a few days! It is a miserable and stressful place to work and so this turnover is not very surprising. The culture at Streetbees is one of fear and intimidation. This fear culture filters through all areas of Streetbees, from product development meetings all the way through to the CEO screaming at the interns on a Wednesday afternoon if the Deliveroo order turns up 1 minute later (literally) than 12:30. As an aside, I have no idea why the CEO goes crazy if the Deliveroo order arrives at 12:31, but she does go mad and watching a powerful CEO scream and shout at a group of interns over something so trivial is not pleasant. The CEO is by the far the worst person I\u2019ve ever worked with and is entirely responsible for the cultural and operational problems at Streetbees. The other co-founder is aware of the issues that exist, but is unable or unwilling to do anything about it. Meanwhile, lots of people continue to leave Streetbees each month and employee morale is always extremely low. Transparency isn\u2019t something that is valued, despite what the founders say. There isn\u2019t anything close to a collaborative or supportive working environment, there is little opportunity for organisational or individual learning and growth and it is absolutely not a fun or fulfilling place to work. Work\/life balance is non-existent and project deadlines are ridiculous. You are expected to work late every single evening and on weekends. It got to the point where I felt like I needed to have my laptop with me wherever I went on the weekends, just in case I got that dreaded message from the CEO demanding something immediately. I could go on, but to summarise, working at Streetbees is relentless, miserable, stressful and thankless and my advice would be to avoid at all costs.

Awesome location too. The product has so much potential! Cons Expectations are completely unrealistic. You will be burned out, and there will be nothing you can do about it apart from leaving the company. It feels like the worst of both worlds startup and corporate: insane amounts of stuff to do, dealing with extremely top down hierarchy, micromanagement, and not a lot of sense of security or reward. Startups are lots of hard work: but there is no sense of progress, and a toxic culture around expectation that make hard work at Streetbees unbearable. There is a massive fear culture: and it's hard because you feel like you're not _allowed_ to make mistakes. A lot of startups are about making mistakes and becoming stronger and growing as a business and individuals. In this company mistakes make you fear about your job. Many people left (at one time, it was 1 or 2 per week) because of the pressure, or because of mistakes they made being a cause for their termination. It feels like nobody is happy to be working at Streetbees. It really dampens the morale. Advice to Management The distinct lack of product vision, understanding about technological capabilities and really listening to employees have been the most frustrating things for me. Work on understanding the talents of the brilliant people you have hired, and inspire people to do good work, rather than scaring them into doing it.","title":"Not a happy place to work","prediction":"customer"}]
