Thinking objectively on a company, I factor in profitability (as this directly influences my future stability), business strategy, and employee engagement. To speak to the first two points of profitability and business strategy, World First has made great strides in the past few months. While the cost-cutting measures taken are really difficult for those directly involved, as well as detrimental to the morale of current employees, to my mind they were necessary for the long term health of the business. Changes have been made, and change is uncomfortable, but status quo can often be the enemy of progress; in my opinion changes were needed. I think World First is making strides in improving overall business strategy and profitability. Regarding employee engagement, as mentioned before there has been a blow to morale. What I'd like to mention, though, is the people that World First hires and how it treats those employees. Having been employed with other companies, both larger and smaller, I can say that that hiring that World First does is pretty exceptional. There are some genuinely great people that work there, and we can trust each other to do our jobs. That's something that I don't think gets valued enough. As to how World First treats employees, benefits are good and always improving, and I've never seen a company so willing move people around to different parts of the business to find a better fit like World First does. To me that's a huge mark of caring for your employees and helping them to better themselves and be happier in what they do. To my mind, a lot of people don't appreciate the freedom and flexibility World First gives its employees to suggest improvements and self-manage. Cons World First is in a bit of a rebuilding phase.

The systems are antiquated, and although they are making efforts to improve them, it is at a glacial pace with all of the decisions being made out of the London headquarters. Very few people with any working knowledge of the incoming systems from the U.S. office have been asked to help with these integrations which will ultimately result in the U.S. being the red headed step-child they have always been; constantly asking for things we needed to be successful but never actually receiving the tools we need. One example would come in the form of lead generation - the U.K. refused to help the U.S. business with placing lead forms on the site although they were happy to do it for the London office with no question. All efforts have been focused on the Asia market instead, and even though there were several workarounds which would require no assistance from the U.K., ideas were simply shot down. Anyone who has ever worked in marketing would know that dedicated landing pages linked from a pay-per-click ad is a best practice to give people specific information they are seeking. Pushing to the website which can hold more information than is palatable can and will often result in higher bounce rates, yet these autonomous solutions were presented to no avail. Anytime new ideas which were brought to the table they were often overlooked due to lack of resources, lack of will on key employees to actually do their jobs and try new things, or complete and utter lack of communication from top executives in the company. Nepotism is another issue with this company. They keep people who have been there, or are from the headquarters, beyond their actual lifetime value to the company.

The company has been around for about 12 years and, as you might have gleaned from some of the previous reviews, has had a difficult 12 months. I noticed first hand how hard it can be to continue growth; from a commercial, cultural, technology and customer focus perspective.","pros":"Nice, friendly people across all levels of the organisation","rating":3,"text":"Pros Nice, friendly people across all levels of the organisation Some really great and passionate people Cons Working at World First has made me realise that scaling and maintaining growth can both be incredibly hard. The company has been around for about 12 years and, as you might have gleaned from some of the previous reviews, has had a difficult 12 months. I noticed first hand how hard it can be to continue growth; from a commercial, cultural, technology and customer focus perspective. Whilst some of the previous, more negative reviews, might feel somewhat hyperbolic, I wouldn't completely ignore them. Certain points in previous reviews do resonate with me: - I did also observe a culture of 'old boys' (and girls) and struggled to change it. It's notable, particularly at a more senior level where employees seem to have come from the same company (i.e. Ozforex) or network. As a result, there were examples of people with special privileges or carrying out roles that they weren't necessarily the best fit for. It feels fair to say that World First isn't probably the most diverse company I've ever worked for. - Leadership is hard, especially as your company grows. I feel it's unfair to single out the CEO, as he started the company and has led a long period of growth and commercial success. However, I got the impression that the executive and senior management team would benefit from having strong, experienced professionals who've 'been there and done that'. People who've worked at rapid growth companies and dealt with scaling challenges. Others might disagree, but I strongly believe that World First would benefit from more experienced people joining its (senior) ranks, ideally people who haven't necessarily come through the ranks at World First and people with a fresh perspective from having worked in completely different industries (see my previous point about diversity). - Like any other company, World First does suffer from internal politics. However, listening to people who've been in the business from the early days, it made me realise how 'scaling' transparency is hard. Despite the CEO's best efforts to hold regular \"state of the nation\" type sessions, there seemed to be an awful lot going on behind closed doors (e.g. decisions about partnerships, internal promotions, new projects). Truly living and breathing company values such as \"openness\" and \"courageous\" on a daily basis and I saw this firsthand as World First was trying to continue its growth. - Attracting and retaining good people is hard. As a result of the last 12 months, a lot of good professional people from across the business have moved. Again, this isn't something which is unique to World First but it does mean that you don't get the diversity of background and experience that I've experienced at other companies. Advice to Management Carve out some time to really take stock and \"pause\". Even if it's for a few days; pause external hires or internal promotions, and reflect on company direction and priorities for 2018 and beyond. This way, you'll be able to offer new joiners (and people being promoted from within) with a clear strategic direction , strong company values that people can rally behind and a better working environment. If you're a job seeker and have got different job opportunities to consider, you might want to ask in your interview process whether the senior management has reflected on things, and if so, what their path going forward looks like (and why).","title":"Nice people, but don't ignore some of the more negative reviews","prediction":"collaboration"},{"advice":"Give some training to junior management","cons":"Poor management -","pros":"Nice office view","rating":1,"text":"Pros Nice office view Chocolate trolley\/ beer fridge Free breakfast Cons Poor management - First example - i got the impression that my future in the company isn't based on my performance as from my observation the compliance operation team leaders were promoted not based on their merit\/ experience. Furthermore, there were 2 team leaders plus 1 manager managing only 6\/7 associates and yet despite the ratio they were unable to manage staff schedules effectively. There was a period when both team leaders as well as half of the team went on annual leave at the same time, yet when we were back to relatively normality I was asked to reschedule my annual leave for medical appointment due to shortage staff. It's difficult not to feel 'double standards' at play. Second example - junior compliance ops management should learn the meaning of ''effective communication' and 'knowledge transfer', they assumed you know\/ aware of certain 'hidden' ways of working but they would abruptly critique the fact of raising a question when the only reason for doing so is to find out about said ways. Third example is allowing siblings to work within same team. One as manager, one as associate. Whilst I don't have issues with working with the associate, nor do I think the associate is not capable, this is still poor management\/ company culture that is not heard of in a reputable financial company. Discriminatory behaviour - During my time, I tried not to get involved in office politics, stayed away from 'the big group' and kept as low profile as I can. But eventually got bullied because they think I won't fight back. I don't suggest anyone who is native foreign language speaker to join this team. As a non native English speaker, I knew I should and I indeed only spoke in English for work related things. However, I was told 'English only' even for personal conversation, or go somewhere else if I need to chat in a foreign language. Nevertheless, management themselves can speak in foreign languages even for work related issue. If this is not discrimination\/ racist, I don't know what it is. Having studied and worked in London for some years, Ive never felt so discrimited, I was disgusted to have to go through this in this renowned fintech company. HR was really helpful and supportive on this issue and I believe language discrimination is not 'WF's policy' but only stemmed junior management's Nigel Farage style thinking. With that in mind, training should be conducted especially for junior management as they refused to except HR and WF general direction. Inconsistent compliance policy - As an compliance associate who has experience working in a more structured and professional organisation,I felt that there are too many inconsistencies in the approval process. I was trained on the processes however subsequently I have found that there were many 'exceptions to the rule' and reasons for said exceptions were never clearly explained, yet I was 'expected to know' them and was in the firing line when I did things 'by the book'. I don't know whether this is attributed to poor training or unprofessional practices between sales team, client service and compliance ops team. As a result, I just did whatever the team leader said even I felt the decisions\/ exceptions didn't make sense at all. I also felt that, there are a lot of unnecessary and unclear compliance questions to the clients. This also creates a lot of conflicts between comp ops team and CR. Poor office equipment- One thing I promise to mention is- computers are really really really old. Hardly believe this is a fintech company to be honest. Took me at least 10-15mins to get the computer working every morning, probably will take at least 30mins on an unlucky Monday morning. ( we hot desk so it's not my own computer's problem) Office is not probably clean. Consider to vacuum the carpet regularly maybe? Also, pantry is a mess after lunch.

More importantly, some leaders\/managers have fostered an extremely unprofessional and toxic environment promoting gossip, negative chatter and passive aggression towards their own team members. As time passed by I felt more and more like I was in high school surrounded by cliques rather than working with other professionals and this made it extremely difficult to concentrate on day-to- day work. From what I heard, HR have been told about this repeatedly especially in exit inverviews but have failed to do anything about this. \u00a0It is a serious shame that my experience of working here has been overshadowed by the negativity and I really wish it hadn't as it hasn't all been bad (especially at the start when I didn't notice these issues) and again I know that it was not like this for every person.

However, I hope it changes so that it can truly become a 'people first' culture for my ex-collegauges and anyone who wishes to work here in the future. Advice to Management - Please listen to what these reviews and employees have to say about management, this is clearly an issue and the negativity is not just a product of the redundancies that took place earlier this year. - Please train management especially those who have not had any experience managing people before on how to communicate with their team and enforce positivity and collaboration. Or, just hire experienced managers. -Please acknowledge that there is a culture problem whether it be 'old boys' or 'lads club' there is definitely an 'in crowd' who drink and gossip together resulting an 'us and them' environment at the workplace. This can be off-putting for people (especially newcomers) who enjoy a good drink after work but feel uncomfortable hearing managers gossip about other team members from the outset. - I know HR are trying very hard to create a good culture and that you can't change peoples behaviours or personalities. I also know that workplace politics happens everywhere. Hence, I do not think ex-employees are leaving all these negative reviews just to be bitter, I'm sure like me they still think that the culture can be improved.

General historical under investment in non-commercial roles has left the business playing catch while attempting to grow quickly, applying pressure in lots of areas Communication across the business has historically been poor, but is improving Advice to Management Dont get so hung up on being a fun company. Generally successful intelligent people dont come to work wanting to be somewhere that is 'fun' - yes you want to work somewhere you enjoy working and like your colleagues, but priority one is working a well functioning successful business. I feel the former has sometime been a larger concern than the latter. If you trust your hiring team to hire the right people, the fun atmosphere will manifest itself. Communicate better, the strategy was very confused until recently, this has improved, however prioritisation wise it still feels the focus changes too regularly Continue to make tough decisions, but learn from your mistakes - anyone working in the business 4 months ago could tell there were way to many staff and lots of free loaders, however it was also managements duty to prevent situations like that occurring. Push accountability, historically there hasn't been enough of this.

There is no REAL long-term strategy (at the moment) to the current rapidly evolving, hyper-competitive FX market place. There is very little definitive TRACTION. What do customers REALLY want? To this, management is like a frightened ostrich - burying it's head in the sand. Simultaneously, it points the finger at it's employees, blaming them for their own lack of direction, competency, initiative and insight as to what is ACTUALLY happening in the marketplace. The company announcement of 80 redundancies recently is a direct reflection of this. To quote a review that has since been pulled from this site: \"emails and internal memos are filled with rambling fear mongering and one upmanship, while in real life, the back stabbing and cut-throat antics of senior to middle management play out like a script in a Machiavellian novel.\" As alarming as this sounds, it is frighteningly accurate. There are also some serious, ironic, disingenuous and dishonest practices that are going on in management. Incompetency will create unforced errors and mistakes. They then will lie, to cover up.

In almost every country that this company has an office in, there is a bunch of inept wannabes at the leadership helm who live in insecurity that someone is going to be find out that they are completely lost and\/or unqualified to lead. Their leadership styles reflect this - emails and internal memos are filled with rambling fear mongering and one upmanship, while in real life, the back stabbing and cut-throat antics of senior to middle management play out like a script in a Machiavellian novel. The only exception to the infighting is directly correlated to indiscreet nepotism as management give their mates or old colleagues jobs - so they can build stronger teams to fight other managers with. Managers are so insecure about their worth and jobs that if you happen to have a difference of opinion or slightly more knowledge in an area to your manager to the point whereby they might feel threatened by you, be prepared to be bullied with silent treatment, being left out of important meetings or processes you should be in, hot\/cold treatment and gaslighting. That's after they lie to your face, purposely ignore your emails, cut off your access to other managers and gossip about you behind your back to others in the organization. They'll also actively try and block you from moving up or around the organization even though they promise \"international mobility\" (in actual fact, they prefer to hire externally and locally because its cheaper than shifting internal expertise around. Again, the only exception is if you are part of the \"boys club\") Almost everyone else is a graduate (because the pay is dismal) which means professionalism and technical capabilities are low organization-wide. The graduates that love the culture of drinking, gossiping and slacking off for half the day stay in the company longer than they should and because everyone else with actual ambition to work somewhere decent leaves, the drinkers and slackers that have never worked anywhere else get promoted through links to the boys club \/ tenure and 'loyalty'.
