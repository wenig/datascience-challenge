It also seemed like the previous CEOs were at least trying to establish a good culture and a set of core values within the whole company. Cons None of the positive things mentioned above are true anymore. A series of management changes over the last few months revealed the true face of the company. The new management only needed 3 months to establish an atmosphere of fear, uncertainty and doubt. People were fired without notice for \"questioning authority\" after they gave the wrong kind of feedback. Others were threatened and told that their only job is to follow orders and not question their superiors. The whole Product & Development department got lectured on which kinds of feedback are allowed and which can get you fired. Most of the people in the development team have already left or are in the process of leaving. There seems to be some interest in rebuilding the team from scratch, but it's questionable whether the people currently in charge of that effort will manage to find adequate replacements for all the people who are leaving, at least within the foreseeable future. In general, there seems to be no empathy left for employees, and the rest of fun and exciting startup atmosphere has vanished. Plus now there's even less of an idea how to become more than a clone of Airbnb, which the company has been struggling with for the last three years. There's no innovation, no interest in improving the product, no vision and no leadership. The most valuable thing I learned here is: Don't work for a company that doesn't have a convincing genuine idea at its core. Wimdu definitely doesn't have one. And what's worse, it isn't even trying to find it (anymore). Advice to Management Treat people with respect, value feedback (yes, every kind of feedback), establish an atmosphere of trust and encourage people to take initiative.

The company is built up on interns, while several key positions are filled by inexperienced employes. While the general atmosphere amongst the teams could be describe as good, the general company atmosphere sways between frustration and disappointment. While there isnt generally anything wrong with hiring interns, the company hires them as a cheap labor alternative with no real intention of keeping them on board for the long term, which results in a constant state of disorganization and loss of knowledge. Most interns who get hired, aren't aware that this isn't what an Internship should be like - and while the work isn't hard, everything that one learns can be summed up in 2 hours. Work consists of the same menial tasks over and over again. The biggest issue might be the fact that the management - especially Arne Bleckwenn and Hinrich Dreiling have no clue how to \"people manage\" and run a company. Their lack of direct and intelligent leadership only enhances the feeling that Wimdu is a copy cat clone of AirBnb looking for a quick exit (which they have clearly missed).
