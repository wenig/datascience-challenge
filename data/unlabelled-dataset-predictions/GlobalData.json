Good suggestion by one of the reviews below to each out for lunch every day. Paying the typical \u00a38 for lunch in the area is not cheap on analyst salaries but analyst should prioritise networking over social life. GD recognises that in other companies the paying of bonus in highly politicised and controversial, so good decision on punishing everyone equally. Unlike other companies, GD is not elitist in anyway. In fact they have shown they are more progressive by having an \"inverted pyramid\" structure where the slowest people are promoted each year. Cons Due to restructuring, we no longer get to hear ITs humourous one liners.

Senior management are terrible at checking in on analysts and communicating the most basic of things.

This should not be allowed to happen, and it wouldn\u2019t if senior management actually cared. I will point out that this is not the case for all senior managers, some of whom are very competent and do care about analysts\u2019 progression, but in general it\u2019s a very poor show. The office is a complete joke \u2013 no hot water, fridge or microwave despite numerous petitions. All facilities are terrible and it is genuinely the worst office I could ever imagine anyone in a developed country would have to set foot in - you have to see it to believe it. It\u2019s probably nicer in Guantanamo Bay. Morale among employees is incredibly low \u2013 everyone constantly moans about their jobs and the company which creates a very depressing environment to work in. Turnover is really high (one analyst leaves every 2 weeks at least) which makes things worse. Senior management do not care about this, however, as it is part of the business model, so don\u2019t expect things to change any time soon. IT infrastructure is woeful. Most of the phones and Ethernet cables in meeting rooms do not work. You would think the company is on its last legs financially, and the whole places reeks of under investment and a lack of quality. Long hours (9-6) and only 20 days holiday, 3 of which have to be saved to use over the Christmas break when the company is closed anyway, so essentially you only get 17 days holiday which is an absolute joke. Overall, GlobalData is not an enjoyable place to work. It will literally suck the life out of you. It is a terrible environment to work in and I would say that well over half of current analysts are looking to leave\/want to leave. GlobalData can offer you a job, not a career.

The fact that there are so many positive reviews makes me strongly suspect many have been written by shills at the instruction of senior management, something that is highly characteristic of their approach to problems at the company. The IT is the biggest joke of any company I have ever worked at - there are far too few staff in this department, and the vast majority of the computers are well below the specs they should be for the roles they are being used to support. Much of the software used is also decades old, and often unsuitable. The vast majority of the teams are also woefully underesourced, with a fraction of the staff needed to do the work at hand properly. Many have no budgets for basic things to support their work, and it is not uncommon for people to end up funding things out of their own pockets simply to do their jobs properly. There is an unwillingness to spend money on anything, no matter how much of a good business case it is, with employees expected to work miracles and match rivals with budgets ten times the size. Communication between the senior management and the rest of the staff is almost non-existent, with changes coming out of the blue, and contradictory decisions being made on a regular basis. Staff with expertise are never consulted on decisions, meaning many of those made are totally unworkable. The average pay is well below market rate. Regular pay rises do not exist, and attempts to negotiate pay increases are made near impossible by the fact that non-managerial employees do not have access to anyone with the power to approve them. There is also little in the way of career progression opportunities. The company also breaks people. There is a fairly abusive culture, with employees often being very aggressive to each other, and refusing to support each other when required. This appears to stem from the attitude of the CEO and trickles down through the company. This combined with the lack of resources results in many people becoming highly stressed and burning out. The office is also filthy, and too small for the number of people who work there. This is a terrible place to work. Do not work here if you have any other options. Advice to Management Invest in your employees, transform your attitude, or possibly just set the whole business on fire and start again from scratch.","title":"Terrible employer - other reviews likely fake","prediction":"customer"},{"advice":null,"cons":"Repititive work process.
